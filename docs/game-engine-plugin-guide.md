# Writing a Game Engine plugin

The **Game Engine** layer adapts the bmad-loop dev/sweep cycle to projects whose
work needs a **live engine Editor** — e.g. a Unity project the agent drives through
an Editor MCP. It is niche and **opt-in**: a normal project enables no engine
plugin and the orchestrator behaves exactly as before.

As of the plugin-system migration, **the game engine is just a plugin** on the
general [plugin system](plugin-authoring-guide.md). There is no separate engine
machinery: an engine plugin uses the same `plugin.toml` manifest, the same
[lifecycle hooks](plugin-authoring-guide.md#stage-reference), and the same trust
model as any other plugin. This guide covers the **engine-specific** slice —
which stages an Editor binds, the `editor_mode` ↔ isolation coupling, and the env
a readiness/setup script reads. **Read the [plugin authoring
guide](plugin-authoring-guide.md) first** for the manifest, settings, hook, and
trust fundamentals.

Unity ships bundled as the reference engine plugin
(`src/bmad_loop/data/plugins/unity/`). This guide is for adding **another engine**
(Godot, Unreal, …) — or reshaping the Unity one for your project. For wiring a
specific Editor MCP (IvanMurzak vs CoplayDev, readiness probing, the full env-var
reference), see the companion [Game Engine MCP guide](game-engine-mcp-guide.md).

> ready, you can write an engine plugin — no in-process code required.

## How an engine plugin is loaded

Like any plugin, it's a directory with a `plugin.toml` (plus helper scripts),
discovered and overlaid from:

| Source        | Path                                              | Wins         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Bundled       | `bmad_loop/data/plugins/<name>/plugin.toml`       | base         |
| Project-local | `<project>/.bmad-loop/plugins/<name>/plugin.toml` | **override** |

A project-local plugin with the **same name** overrides the bundled one. The
plugin's directory is its `{scripts}` dir, so its manifest and helper scripts sit
together.

Enable it in `.bmad-loop/policy.toml`:

```toml
[plugins]
enabled = ["unity"]          # or your engine's name

[plugins.unity]
editor_mode = "shared"
mcp = "ivanmurzak"
```

> **Legacy `[engine]` still works.** A pre-migration `[engine] name = "unity"`
> block loads with a deprecation warning, folded into the `[plugins]` allowlist
> plus a `[plugins.unity]` table. The _policy block_ is the only thing folded,
> though — project-local plugin overrides are now discovered under
> `.bmad-loop/plugins/<name>/`, so move an old `.bmad-loop/engines/unity/`
> override dir to `.bmad-loop/plugins/unity/`. Migrate to `[plugins]` when
> convenient.

## Mapping the Editor lifecycle onto hook stages

An engine binds the orchestrator's **per-story stages** that surround a unit's
worktree and sessions. The relevant ones (full list in the
[stage reference](plugin-authoring-guide.md#stage-reference)):

| Stage                            | shared mode                                                  | per_worktree mode                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pre_worktree_setup`             | not run                                                      | per unit, right after the worktree is cut — make it a usable project + launch its Editor                                          |
| `pre_ready_gate`                 | once, before the first session                               | per unit, after setup, before the agent runs — block until Editor + MCP are ready                                                 |
| (agent dev/review)               | drives the operator's live Editor                            | drives the worktree's managed Editor                                                                                              |
| `pre_worktree_teardown`          | not run                                                      | per unit, on completion **and** on pause/escalation — quit the Editor + clean up                                                  |
| `pre_rollback` / `post_rollback` | per failed attempt, around the rollback's `git reset --hard` | same — quiesce the Editor (save + close open scenes) before the reset rewrites tracked files under it, refresh assets after       |
| `post_run`                       | once, on clean finish                                        | once, on clean finish — reclaim per-run scratch (the Unity plugin clears the MCP server's `/tmp` zips + truncates its editor log) |

A **blocking** hook at `pre_ready_gate` or `pre_worktree_setup` whose command
exits non-zero **defers the unit** — bmad-loop never starts a session against a
half-open Editor. `pre_worktree_teardown`, `pre_rollback`, and `post_rollback` are
**observe-only** for veto purposes (a veto can't un-tear-down or un-reset) but the
command still **runs** — best-effort, even when a unit pauses or escalates, so a
managed Editor never outlives its worktree and a rollback is never stalled by a
wedged Editor. The Unity plugin uses `pre_rollback` to save + close open scenes
before the reset, so a shared Editor holding a dirty scene never raises the
run-freezing "scene changed on disk" modal.

You can implement these as **declarative** `[hooks.<stage>]` shell commands (the
smallest thing that works), or as an **in-process** `[python]` module when you need
richer logic. The bundled Unity plugin is in-process because it also does MCP
agent routing, `editor_mode`↔isolation validation, and Library priming — but a
simple engine needs none of that.

## The `editor_mode` ↔ `[scm] isolation` coupling

A live Editor MCP can only act on the folder its Editor has open, and most engines
bind one Editor per folder and can't be repointed live. So an engine's
`editor_mode` setting is coupled to `[scm] isolation`:

- **`shared`** requires `[scm] isolation = "none"` — the agent works **in place**
  on the project your warm Editor already has open. Zero relaunches, full live MCP,
  the Editor stays open across stories. The recommended starting point.
- **`per_worktree`** requires `[scm] isolation = "worktree"` — one **managed Editor
  per worktree**, run serially, each launched by your `pre_worktree_setup` hook.

The bundled Unity plugin **enforces** this coupling in its `validate(policy)`
(raising at startup on a mismatch — e.g. `editor_mode = "per_worktree"` with
`isolation = "none"`), and the TUI surfaces it on save. An engine plugin you write
should validate the same way (see
[`Plugin.validate`](plugin-authoring-guide.md#in-process-hooks)).

**Start with `shared` only.** A new engine plugin can support just `shared` and a
single `pre_ready_gate` hook — skip setup/teardown entirely. Add `per_worktree`
once the in-place flow is solid.

## The environment a hook script reads

A declarative hook receives the **generic bus environment** (full table in the
[authoring guide](plugin-authoring-guide.md#declarative-hooks)) — the run/unit
identity plus **`BMAD_LOOP_SETTING_<KEY>`** for each of your `[[settings]]`. So a
readiness script reads its knobs from its own settings:

| Variable                  | Source                                    |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `BMAD_LOOP_WORKTREE`      | the workspace/worktree the Editor opens   |
| `BMAD_LOOP_REPO_ROOT`     | main repo root                            |
| `BMAD_LOOP_STORY_KEY`     | the current story key                     |
| `BMAD_LOOP_SETTING_<KEY>` | each of your plugin's settings (resolved) |

The bundled Unity plugin's in-process module additionally exports
`BMAD_LOOP_ENGINE_MCP`, `BMAD_LOOP_ENGINE_EDITOR_MODE`,
`BMAD_LOOP_ENGINE_READY_TIMEOUT`, `BMAD_LOOP_ENGINE_READY_GRACE`, and
`BMAD_LOOP_UNITY_PATH` for its bundled scripts (derived from its settings) — a
plugin-internal contract, not part of the generic env. The
[Game Engine MCP guide](game-engine-mcp-guide.md) tables every knob the Unity
scripts read.

## Worked example: a minimal `shared`-mode Godot plugin

The smallest useful engine plugin is a single readiness gate. Drop two files under
`<project>/.bmad-loop/plugins/godot/`:

`plugin.toml`:

```toml
[plugin]
name = "godot"
version = "1.0.0"
api_version = 1
description = "Drive a Godot project that needs a live Editor + MCP."

[[settings]]
key = "mcp_url"
type = "str"
default = "http://localhost:9000"
label = "Godot MCP URL"
help = "Where the readiness probe connects."

[[settings]]
key = "ready_timeout_sec"
type = "int"
default = 600
label = "Readiness timeout (sec)"

# Readiness gate: block until the Editor + MCP answer. A non-zero exit defers
# the unit, so a session never starts against a half-open Editor.
[hooks.pre_ready_gate]
cmd = 'python3 "{scripts}/godot_ready.py"'
blocking = true
timeout_sec = 600
```

`godot_ready.py` (exit `0` when the Editor + MCP answer, non-zero otherwise):

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import os, sys, time, socket
from urllib.parse import urlparse

url = os.environ.get("BMAD_LOOP_SETTING_MCP_URL", "http://localhost:9000")
deadline = time.time() + int(os.environ.get("BMAD_LOOP_SETTING_READY_TIMEOUT_SEC", "600"))

host, port = urlparse(url).hostname, urlparse(url).port or 80
while time.time() < deadline:
    try:
        with socket.create_connection((host, port), timeout=2):
            sys.exit(0)                          # ready
    except OSError:
        time.sleep(2)
sys.exit(1)                                       # never came up → unit deferred
```

Then enable it — and keep `[scm] isolation = "none"` (the default) for `shared`:

```toml
[plugins]
enabled = ["godot"]
```

That's a complete engine plugin. To give each unit its own Editor, add
`[hooks.pre_worktree_setup]` + `[hooks.pre_worktree_teardown]` and switch
`[scm] isolation = "worktree"` — see the MCP guide for the per-worktree
port-isolation and seeding mechanics. If you need the `editor_mode`↔isolation
validation or MCP agent routing the Unity plugin does, reach for a `[python]`
module (see the [authoring guide](plugin-authoring-guide.md#in-process-hooks)).

## Reference: the bundled Unity plugin

The canonical example lives at `src/bmad_loop/data/plugins/unity/`:

- `plugin.toml` — a `[python]` module + twelve `[[settings]]` (`editor_mode`, `mcp`,
  `unity_path`, `ready_timeout_sec`, `ready_grace_sec`, plus the modal-dialog knobs
  `install_scene_guard`, `scene_guard_dir`, `quiesce_on_rollback`,
  `quiesce_timeout_sec`, `dialog_probe`, `dialog_probe_interval_sec`,
  `dialog_probe_notify`) + `seed_globs = [".claude/skills/*"]`.
- `unity_plugin.py` — the in-process brain: the readiness gate
  (`on_pre_ready_gate`), `per_worktree` Editor setup/teardown, MCP agent routing,
  Library priming, the `editor_mode`↔`scm.isolation` coupling validation, and the
  modal-dialog defense (scene-guard seeding, rollback quiesce, prompt-fact
  injection, and the detached detect-only probe — see the next section).
- `unity_ready.py` — readiness gate script (branches on `BMAD_LOOP_ENGINE_MCP`).
- `unity_setup.py` — `per_worktree` Library priming, `.mcp.json` write, Custom-mode
  pin, and Editor launch.
- `unity_teardown.py` — Editor quit + MCP-server reap + symlink-Library cleanup +
  dialog-probe reap.
- `unity_seed_assets.py` + `unity_assets/` — seed the `SceneAutoSaveGuard` editor
  script (with fixed-GUID `.meta` files) into the project.
- `unity_quiesce.py` — save + close open scenes before a rollback's `git reset
--hard`, refresh assets after.
- `unity_facts.md` — the scene-save discipline appended to every dev/review prompt.
- `unity_dialog_probe.py` — the detached, detect-only modal-dialog watcher (X11
  only, opt-in).

Each script's module docstring documents every env knob it reads — the
authoritative source if a default ever changes. The [Game Engine MCP guide](game-engine-mcp-guide.md)
distills those into a single reference table and explains the IvanMurzak vs
CoplayDev differences.

## Preventing Editor modal-dialog stalls (Unity)

A live Unity Editor can raise a **modal dialog** — a window that blocks
`EditorApplication.update`, the pump the Unity-MCP plugin uses to dispatch every
tool call. While it is up, all MCP calls time out and the run wedges. The bundled
Unity plugin defends against the two that a bmad-loop run can trip, **in depth**,
so no single failure lets one appear. All four layers are best-effort and none can
block or veto the run.

### The two dialogs, and why they open

The **root cause** is that Unity-MCP GameObject tools
(`com.ivanmurzak.unity.mcp`) call `MarkSceneDirty` but **never save**, so a
project driven by the shared Editor accumulates a chronically **dirty** open scene.
That dirty state is what makes the Editor raise:

1. **"Scene '…' has been changed on disk. Reload the scene?"** — pops when git or
   an agent rewrites the open scene's `.unity` file underneath the Editor. A
   failed-attempt rollback does exactly this: `git reset --hard` rewrites the
   tracked scene file the Editor still holds dirty in memory.
2. **"Do you want to save the changes you made…?"** — pops on Editor quit with a
   dirty scene, e.g. when a `per_worktree` Editor is torn down.

> **Clean scenes are not safe from dialog 1.** Live verification on Unity 6.5.2
> showed the "changed on disk" dialog can pop for a **clean** open scene too — and
> even after dismissal the Editor could stay hard-wedged. Keeping scenes saved
> (layer 1) is therefore necessary but **not sufficient** on the rollback path;
> the quiesce's scene-close (layer 2), which leaves no tracked scene open during
> the reset, is the real protection there.

### 1. `SceneAutoSaveGuard` (seeded editor script)

`unity_seed_assets.py` copies an editor-only C# guard —
`Assets/BmadLoop/Editor/SceneAutoSaveGuard.cs` plus its asmdef, with
pre-generated fixed-GUID `.meta` files — into the project, so the Editor's very
first import already sees it (seeded at `pre_worktree_setup` in `per_worktree`
mode, at `pre_ready_gate` in shared mode where setup never runs). The guard fixes
the **root cause**: it debounce-saves any loaded, on-disk scene ~5 s after it goes
dirty, and on quit it saves pathed scenes (discarding an unsaveable _untitled_
scene by swapping in a fresh empty one, since saving it would itself pop a "Save
As" modal). The quit hook is `EditorApplication.wantsToQuit`; a hard
`EditorApplication.Exit` bypasses it (along with every other quit handler). An operator can toggle it live from the Editor's **`BmadLoop` menu**
("Scene Auto-Save Guard" on/off, "Save Open Scenes Now"); the toggle persists in
`EditorPrefs`, default **on**.

Seeding is idempotent + version-aware (a `bmad-loop-scene-guard-version` header
gates reinstall), never rewrites a file it didn't ship, and a missing `Assets/`
tree is a graceful skip. Because it happens **pre-baseline**, the run's rollback
never treats the guard as a created-this-unit file and never reclaims it — and
**story-finalize's `git add -A` commits the seeded guard into the consumer
project**. That is intended: the guard travels with the repo, so any Editor that
later opens the project is protected. Disable with `install_scene_guard = false`;
relocate with `scene_guard_dir`.

### 2. Rollback quiesce (`pre_rollback` / `post_rollback`)

The seeded guard cannot help a scene that goes dirty _during_ a failed attempt
that is about to be rolled back, so the plugin also **quiesces the Editor around
the reset**. At `pre_rollback` (before `verify.safe_rollback` runs `git reset
--hard`) `unity_quiesce.py` saves every open scene, then opens a fresh empty
untitled scene so **no tracked `.unity` file is open** when the reset rewrites it —
closing the "changed on disk" dialog's window before it can open. At
`post_rollback` it refreshes assets so the Editor drops its stale in-memory copies
and re-imports the reverted tree. The first call doubles as a **wedge probe**: if
the Editor is already unresponsive it fails fast and the quiesce is skipped, at the
cost of one call timeout rather than the whole budget. Every call carries both the
CLI's own `--timeout` and a subprocess-level kill, and the plugin hard-kills the
whole helper past `quiesce_timeout_sec` — so a wedged Editor can **never stall the
rollback**. The quiesce logs to stderr and writes no journal events of its own —
the rollback's journal marker remains `rollback-auto`. Disable with
`quiesce_on_rollback = false`.

### 3. Prompt-fact injection (`pre_session`)

At `pre_session` the plugin appends the scene-save discipline (shipped as
`unity_facts.md`) to every non-empty dev/review prompt, so the agent itself saves
dirty scenes at the boundaries that would otherwise trip a modal — a prompt-only
nudge that complements the automatic guard. A project-local plugin-dir copy of
`unity_facts.md` overrides the shipped text.

### 4. Detect-only dialog probe (opt-in, `dialog_probe`, default off)

The last-resort **observability** net for a modal the first three layers didn't
prevent. When `dialog_probe = true`, the plugin launches a detached
`unity_dialog_probe.py` (shared mode: at `pre_run`; `per_worktree`: per unit at
`pre_worktree_setup`) that polls **xdotool** for a visible Unity-owned window whose
title matches a known dialog phrase and, on a fresh detection, **reports it and
nothing more** — a JSONL record (`<run_dir>/unity-dialog-probe.jsonl`), an
`ATTENTION` line, and a best-effort `notify-send`. **It never clicks, keys, or
closes any window**; clicking a Unity dialog blind could discard work. It is
**X11/Linux only** (a no-op where `DISPLAY` is unset or `xdotool` is absent, so
Windows/macOS fall straight through), self-reaps when the engine pid dies, and is
reaped at `post_run` / worktree teardown via a pid-file handle plus a `/proc`
argv-scan backstop. Tune with `dialog_probe_interval_sec` and
`dialog_probe_notify`.

> The exact dialog titles and the `Unity` window class are **unverified** against a
> live Linux Editor build and kept broad on purpose; detection is advisory, so a
> miss degrades to the pre-existing behavior (a human notices the frozen run),
> never worse. Override `BMAD_LOOP_UNITY_DIALOG_PROBE_CLASS` or the phrase list in a
> project-local plugin copy if your build differs. Detection **is** verified on
> XWayland — but synthetic input (xdotool/ydotool) is unreliable there, one more
> reason the probe only reports: dismissing a detected dialog must stay a human
> action.

## Platform behavior (Linux fast paths, Windows fallbacks)

The Unity plugin's helper scripts are stdlib-only and run identically on Linux,
macOS, and WSL (which **is** Linux — it takes every fast path unchanged). Each
POSIX-only primitive is guarded behind a `sys.platform` branch so a future
native-Windows multiplexer backend can slot in; those Windows branches are
best-effort and **not yet exercised** (no Windows backend ships today). The
guards, by script:

- **`unity_teardown.py` — process discovery.** Linux uses a zero-dependency
  `/proc` scan to find the worktree-bound Editor/MCP-server; non-Linux falls back
  to the same scan over **`psutil`**, imported lazily — a core dependency on
  Windows, the optional `non-linux` extra on macOS (`pip install
'bmad-loop[non-linux]'`) — with a clear error if missing. The
  hard-kill uses `signal.SIGKILL` where present, degrading to `SIGTERM`/`taskkill`
  on Windows. Liveness uses `os.kill(pid, 0)` on POSIX but `psutil.pid_exists` on
  Windows (where `os.kill(pid, 0)` would _terminate_ the process).
- **`unity_setup.py` — Library priming + launch.** The warm-Library copy keeps the
  `cp -a --reflink` CoW fast path on POSIX (near-free on btrfs/xfs) and falls back
  to `shutil.copytree` where `cp` is absent. The empty-cache symlink fallback wraps
  `symlink_to` in `try/except OSError`, dropping to a real per-worktree dir (cold,
  no cross-run cache) where symlinks need privilege (Windows). Editor detach uses
  `start_new_session` on POSIX, `CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP` on Windows.
- **`unity_cleanup.py` — temp-cache scrub.** Unity's `temporaryCachePath` base is
  exactly `/tmp` on Linux (kept byte-for-byte); other platforms derive it from
  `tempfile.gettempdir()`. **Caveat:** native Windows Unity actually uses
  `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Temp\<company>\<product>`, which `gettempdir()` does
  not always resolve to — getting that cache root exactly right is a documented
  follow-up for when a Windows backend lands.

When authoring your own engine plugin, mirror this discipline: stdlib-only scripts,
optional extras imported lazily, and every POSIX-ism behind a `sys.platform` branch
with a `# portability:` comment. See the [plugin authoring guide](plugin-authoring-guide.md#platform-portability)
for the general rule.
