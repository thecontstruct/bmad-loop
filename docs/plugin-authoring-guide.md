# Writing a bmad-loop plugin

A **plugin** extends the bmad-loop orchestrator **without touching its core loop**.
It can be as simple as a settings-only data file or as complex as the bundled
Unity game-engine layer. A plugin can:

- **observe, veto, or mutate** the run at every lifecycle stage (a _hook bus_);
- contribute **settings** that render in the settings TUI and persist to policy;
- inject its own **workflow** sessions at defined points in the dev/review cycle.

Plugins are **folder-drop**: a directory with a `plugin.toml` manifest (plus any
helper scripts) dropped under `.bmad-loop/plugins/<name>/`. No registration, no
install step. A plugin that ships **in-process Python** is loaded only when you
**trust** it by name — dropping a folder in never runs code.

> Already wrote a [CLI adapter profile](../README.md#other-coding-clis) or the old
> `[engine]` block? Same idea — declarative TOML + optional scripts, discovered and
> overlaid. The plugin system generalizes both.

## Quick start: the smallest plugin

A data-only plugin carries one setting and zero behavior. Create
`.bmad-loop/plugins/hello/plugin.toml`:

```toml
[plugin]
name = "hello"
version = "1.0.0"
api_version = 1
description = "Smallest possible plugin."
author = "you"

[[settings]]
key = "greeting"
type = "str"
default = "hi"
label = "Greeting"
help = "Shown in the settings UI once this plugin is enabled."
```

That's a complete, loadable plugin. It has no `[hooks]` and no `[python]`, so it
runs no code and is byte-identical to "no plugin" at run time — it exists only to
contribute a setting. This is the shape the bundled
[`example`](../src/bmad_loop/data/plugins/example/plugin.toml) plugin ships in.

A setting-only section appears in the TUI only once the plugin is **enabled**:

```toml
# .bmad-loop/policy.toml
[plugins]
enabled = ["hello"]
```

---

## Distribution & discovery

Plugins are discovered from three sources, overlaid in precedence order (a later
same-name plugin **overrides** an earlier one; a new name **extends** the set):

| Source        | Path                                              | Precedence             |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Builtin       | `bmad_loop/data/plugins/<name>/plugin.toml`       | base                   |
| Entry point   | `bmad_loop.plugins` group                         | _reserved (see below)_ |
| Project-local | `<project>/.bmad-loop/plugins/<name>/plugin.toml` | **highest**            |

Each plugin lives in its **own directory** — that directory is the plugin's
`{scripts}` root (see [`{scripts}` substitution](#scripts-substitution)), so its
manifest and helper scripts sit together.

**Entry points are a documented future seam.** `discover()` already yields an
`entry_point` source between builtin and project, but `_discover_entry_points()`
returns nothing today — folder-drop is the only live distribution path. When
pip-installable plugins land, they slot in here with **no change to authors or to
discovery order** (`importlib.metadata` selectable entry points, group
`bmad_loop.plugins`). See `src/bmad_loop/plugins/loader.py`.

---

## The manifest (`plugin.toml`)

Every plugin is one `plugin.toml`. Only `[plugin] name` + `api_version` are
required; every section below is optional, so a plugin opts into exactly what it
needs. The manifest parses into the immutable `PluginManifest`
(`src/bmad_loop/plugins/model.py`).

### `[plugin]` — metadata

| Field         | Type   | Default | Purpose                                                                         |
| ------------- | ------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`        | string | —       | **Required.** Plugin id; the directory name; the `[plugins.<name>]` key.        |
| `api_version` | int    | —       | **Required.** Plugin-API version this manifest targets (currently `1`).         |
| `version`     | string | `0.0.0` | Your plugin's own version.                                                      |
| `description` | string | `""`    | One line; shown in tooling.                                                     |
| `author`      | string | `""`    | Attribution.                                                                    |
| `priority`    | int    | `0`     | Cross-plugin ordering at a shared stage; **lower runs first**, then load order. |
| `seed_files`  | list   | `[]`    | Project-relative gitignored files to copy into each isolated worktree.          |
| `seed_globs`  | list   | `[]`    | Project-relative glob patterns to expand + copy into each worktree.             |

`seed_files` / `seed_globs` must be **project-relative** (an absolute path is
rejected at load). They let a plugin prime an isolated checkout with gitignored
paths it needs — e.g. the Unity plugin seeds an MCP-generated skill tree.

### `[[settings]]` — settings schema

Each entry contributes one setting. See [Settings](#settings) for the full
reference.

```toml
[[settings]]
key = "strict"        # required; unique within the plugin
type = "bool"         # bool | int | float | str | select
default = false
label = "Strict mode" # TUI label (falls back to the key)
help = "..."          # TUI help text
# select-only:
# options = ["a", "b"]
# numeric hints (int/float):
# min = 0
# max = 10
```

### `[hooks.<stage>]` — declarative (out-of-process) hooks

A shell command bound to a [lifecycle stage](#stage-reference). See
[Hooks](#hooks).

```toml
[hooks.pre_session]
cmd = 'python3 "{scripts}/probe.py"'
timeout_sec = 120          # default 120; must be >= 1
blocking = true            # non-zero exit vetoes (defers) the unit
fail_closed = false        # default: a hook *error* (timeout/launch) fails open
```

### `[python]` — in-process module (trust-gated)

```toml
[python]
module = "hooks.py"        # plugin-relative file
class = "MyPlugin"         # subclass of bmad_loop.plugins.Plugin (default "Plugin")
```

Declaring `[python]` makes the **whole plugin trust-gated**: the module is never
imported unless the plugin is in `[plugins] enabled`. See [Trust](#trust--safety).

### `[workflows.<name>]` — provided workflows

An extra agent session injected at a stage. See [Workflows](#workflows-provides).

```toml
[workflows.lint-sweep]
stage = "post_dev_phase"   # post_dev_phase | post_review_result | pre_commit_gate
role = "dev"               # dev | review
prompt = "/lint-sweep {story_key}"
blocking = false           # true: a failed session defers the unit
```

Declare `<name>_enabled` / `<name>_blocking` settings to let operators disable a
step or flip its gate per run — see
[Making a workflow configurable](#making-a-workflow-configurable).

### `{scripts}` substitution

In any hook `cmd` or workflow `prompt`, `{scripts}` expands to the plugin's own
directory — so a plugin references its bundled scripts without hardcoding a path
that breaks across machines or between a builtin and a project-local copy.

---

## Trust & safety

There are **two trust tiers**, by design:

1. **Declarative tier (always runs).** A data-only or declarative plugin —
   settings + `[hooks.<stage>]` shell commands — loads and runs as soon as it is
   discovered. This is the same risk surface as the old `engine.toml *_cmd` hooks
   or a project's verify commands: operator-authored shell, trusted by virtue of
   living in the repo.

2. **In-process tier (trust-gated).** A plugin that declares a `[python]` module
   is **never imported or executed** unless its `name` is in:

   ```toml
   [plugins]
   enabled = ["my-plugin"]
   ```

   **Dropping a `[python]` plugin folder in never runs its code.** The module
   (and anything it provides that depends on the module — its `on_<stage>`
   handlers, its `validate`, and its provided **workflows**) stays inert until you
   list it. An un-enabled `[python]` plugin is recorded `plugin-untrusted` in the
   run journal.

**Failure isolation.** Every hook — subprocess or Python — is wrapped. A Python
handler that raises is caught (`except Exception` only — `RunStopped`/SIGTERM as
`BaseException` always propagate), journalled `plugin-error`, and the offending
instance is **disabled for the rest of the run**. The run survives. A blocking
declarative hook fails **open** by default (an error lets the run continue; only a
clean non-zero exit vetoes); set `fail_closed = true` to make any failure defer
the unit. An in-process handler can opt into the same by setting `fail_closed =
True` on its class.

**Versioning.** Every manifest declares `api_version`. The framework supports a
set of versions (`SUPPORTED_API`). A **builtin** with an unsupported version is a
hard error (a packaging bug we shipped); a **third-party** one is **skipped with a
warning** (`plugin-skipped`) so a stale drop-in can never take a run down.

---

## Settings

A `[[settings]]` entry is presentation + validation metadata. The vocabulary
matches the core settings fields exactly:

| Field       | Applies to    | Meaning                                          |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `key`       | all           | Unique within the plugin; the policy + env key.  |
| `type`      | all           | `bool` \| `int` \| `float` \| `str` \| `select`. |
| `default`   | all           | Value when the operator hasn't set one.          |
| `label`     | all           | TUI label (falls back to `key`).                 |
| `help`      | all           | TUI help text.                                   |
| `options`   | `select`      | Non-empty list of allowed string values.         |
| `min`/`max` | `int`/`float` | Numeric bounds (widget hints).                   |

**Rendering.** Once a plugin is enabled, its settings appear as their own section
in the settings TUI (generated from the schema — see
`src/bmad_loop/settings_schema.py`). They persist to a `[plugins.<name>]` table in
`policy.toml`:

```toml
[plugins]
enabled = ["my-plugin"]

[plugins.my-plugin]
strict = true
mode = "b"
```

**Reading a setting.**

- In an **in-process** plugin: `self.settings["strict"]` — the manifest defaults
  overlaid by the operator's `[plugins.<name>]` table.
- In a **declarative** hook: each setting is exported as an environment variable
  `BMAD_LOOP_SETTING_<KEY>` (uppercased), already resolved.
- Anywhere with a `Policy`: `policy.plugin_setting("my-plugin", "strict", default)`.

Settings are **data**, not code — a plugin can carry `[plugins.<name>]` settings
without being in `enabled` (the settings UI just won't surface a disabled plugin's
section). Only the in-process `[python]` module is trust-gated.

---

## Hooks

A hook binds a [stage](#stage-reference) to behavior. The **hook bus**
(`src/bmad_loop/plugins/bus.py`) fans each stage out to every bound plugin, in
registry order (`priority`, then load order). A run with no plugin bound to a
stage does no work for it (an O(1) fast-path) — zero-plugin runs stay
byte-identical.

### Declarative hooks

A `[hooks.<stage>]` shell command. The bus runs it with:

- **cwd** = the unit's worktree (or repo root);
- a `BMAD_LOOP_*` environment describing the run:

  | Var                                                                               | Meaning                                       |
  | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
  | `BMAD_LOOP_STAGE`                                                                 | the stage firing                              |
  | `BMAD_LOOP_RUN_ID` / `BMAD_LOOP_RUN_DIR`                                          | run identity                                  |
  | `BMAD_LOOP_REPO_ROOT` / `BMAD_LOOP_WORKTREE`                                      | git roots                                     |
  | `BMAD_LOOP_STORY_KEY` / `BMAD_LOOP_ROLE` / `BMAD_LOOP_PHASE` / `BMAD_LOOP_BRANCH` | unit context                                  |
  | `BMAD_LOOP_AGENTS`                                                                | comma-separated CLI agent ids in the worktree |
  | `BMAD_LOOP_PLUGIN`                                                                | your plugin's name                            |
  | `BMAD_LOOP_SETTING_<KEY>`                                                         | each resolved setting                         |

A **blocking** hook's non-zero exit **vetoes** (defers) the unit. A non-blocking
hook is advisory (logged `plugin-hook`).

**Mutating from a declarative hook.** Emit a single JSON object on the **last
non-empty stdout line**:

```json
{
  "shared": { "scanned": 42 },
  "mutate": { "proposed_commit_message": "rewritten by my-plugin" },
  "veto": { "action": "defer", "reason": "lint failed" }
}
```

- `shared` — merged into the cross-stage `shared` dict.
- `mutate` — only [whitelisted fields](#the-hookcontext) for the current stage.
- `veto` — `action` ∈ `skip` \| `defer` \| `pause`. Supplying a `veto` replaces
  the implicit "non-zero exit = defer".

Any non-JSON output is treated as advisory log text.

### In-process hooks

Subclass `bmad_loop.plugins.Plugin` and define `on_<stage>(self, ctx)` methods.
The bus calls the handler for each stage you implement; you only mark the stages
you handle, so the fast path holds for the rest.

```python
from bmad_loop.plugins import Plugin

class MyPlugin(Plugin):
    fail_closed = False   # a raised handler is isolated; True also defers the unit

    def on_pre_commit(self, ctx):
        ctx.proposed_commit_message = f"{ctx.proposed_commit_message}\n\nShipped-by: me"
```

Optionally override `validate(self, policy)` to **reject an incompatible config at
startup** (raise `PluginError`) — e.g. a coupling between a plugin setting and a
core policy field. This runs once before any stage; a raise fails the run fast
(it is a deliberate config rejection, not isolated like a hook bug).

> **Don't do expensive or side-effecting work in `__init__`.** Construction
> happens at registry-build time, and a raised exception there disables the
> instance.

### The `HookContext`

Every hook receives one `HookContext` (`src/bmad_loop/plugins/context.py`) for the
stage. It carries:

- **Read-only facts** (properties, no setter): `run_id`, `story_key`, `epic`,
  `phase`, `attempt`, `role`, `worktree`, `branch`, `repo_root`, `run_dir`,
  `agents`, `result_json` (a copy), `session_status`, `verify_reason`,
  `decision_action`, `settings`. Observe these; you can never rewrite history.
- **A mutable whitelist** — assign only these, and only where the stage allows:
  `proposed_prompt`, `proposed_env`, `proposed_feedback`,
  `proposed_commit_message`, `proposed_decision`.
- **`ctx.shared`** — a free-form, JSON-serializable dict that **persists across
  stages** (the engine backs it with `RunState.plugin_shared`, so it survives
  pause/resume). Use it to carry state between your own hooks.

**Veto** is `ctx.veto(action, reason)`, with `action`:

| Action  | Routes onto the engine's existing… | Effect                                   |
| ------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `skip`  | quiet retire                       | unit dropped (DEFERRED), no notification |
| `defer` | defer primitive                    | unit deferred + operator notified        |
| `pause` | escalation                         | run pauses (raises `RunPaused`)          |

There is **no new abort path** — a veto maps onto control flow the engine already
has. Multiple plugins can object; the bus collects every veto without
short-circuit and resolves the **most-conservative** one (`pause` > `defer` >
`skip`), so load order can never hide a severer objection. A `post_*`-stage veto
is **clamp-conservative only**: a plugin can escalate the engine's own decision,
never silence it.

---

## Stage reference

Stages fire in `pre_`/`post_` pairs around each unit of work. `post_*` stages see
the mutations earlier `pre_*` stages made. The **mutable surface** column lists
what a hook may assign at that stage; everything else on the context is read-only
there.

### Run / loop (no unit — a `pause` veto pauses the run)

| Stage                                      | When                            |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| `pre_run` / `post_run`                     | around the whole run            |
| `pre_pick_next` / `post_pick_next`         | around selecting the next story |
| `pre_epic_boundary` / `post_epic_boundary` | at an epic transition           |

### Story / unit

| Stage                                              | When                                                                              | Mutable surface                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `pre_story` / `post_story`                         | around one story                                                                  | veto (`pre_`)                                         |
| `pre_worktree_setup` / `post_worktree_setup`       | around isolated-worktree provisioning                                             | —                                                     |
| `pre_ready_gate` / `post_ready_gate`               | around the engine-ready gate                                                      | veto (`pre_`)                                         |
| `pre_worktree_teardown` / `post_worktree_teardown` | around teardown (in a `finally`)                                                  | **observe-only** — a veto here cannot un-tear-down    |
| `pre_rollback` / `post_rollback`                   | around a failed attempt's `git reset --hard` (only when a rollback actually runs) | **observe-only** — a veto here cannot block the reset |
| `pre_integrate`                                    | before integrating a finished unit                                                | —                                                     |
| `pre_merge` / `post_merge`                         | around the local branch merge                                                     | —                                                     |

### Dev

| Stage                              | When                             | Mutable surface                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `pre_dev_phase` / `post_dev_phase` | around the dev attempt loop      | veto (`pre_`); `post_dev_phase` is a [workflow injection point](#workflows-provides) |
| `pre_dev_session`                  | before each dev session          | `proposed_prompt`, `proposed_env`, veto                                              |
| `post_dev_verify`                  | after dev or repair verification | —                                                                                    |

`post_dev_verify` fires on **both** legs of the dev phase — once after the dev
session's verification, and again after each repair session's — so a handler sees
it **more than once per story**, not once. The two legs share one `attempt`
counter bounded by `[limits] max_dev_attempts`, which is also the bound on how
many times the stage can fire for one story. Write handlers to be idempotent and
to key on the correlation fields below rather than on the story alone. It also
fires on the way to a pause: an attempt whose session reported a CRITICAL
escalation emits before the run stops, on either leg.

`post_dev_verify` exposes `ctx.command_results`: an immutable tuple of the
per-command `CommandResult` records core just executed. Each has `command`,
`returncode`, the existing merged bounded `output_tail`, separate `stdout`
and `stderr` strings, and `spawn_error` — normally `None`, and set when the child
could not be started at all. The typical cause is the directory it was to run in
(missing, not a directory, or unsearchable), which the message names, but any
spawn-time `OSError` lands here — a missing shell, EMFILE, ENOMEM — so read the
wrapped exception rather than assuming the directory. Such a result carries no
real exit status (`verify.SPAWN_FAULT_RC`, deliberately outside the range a
signal-killed child reports and distinct from the timeout leg's `-1`) and
classifies as an environment fault, which pauses the run. The two stream strings
are intended to be the streams essentially whole
— they are not cut to `[verify] stream_capture_kb`, which bounds only what is
written to disk — but they are not unbounded either: a hard 32 MiB per-stream
ceiling applies, so a pathologically chatty command cannot grow the orchestrator's
peak memory with the number of configured verify commands. When that ceiling cuts
a stream the **tail** is what a plugin receives, and the matching journal record's
`stdout_bytes` / `stderr_bytes` still report what the command emitted, so the cut
is always detectable rather than silent. Ordinary suites never reach it. This is
observation data only: a plugin cannot change the verifier's outcome or the commit
decision. The run's `journal.jsonl` also records
one `verify-command-result` entry per command with run/story/attempt/stage and
verification-sequence correlation — note that `attempt` is the dev/repair counter, so every review
cycle of one attempt shares a single value and only `verification_sequence` tells successive review
passes apart — `output_tail`, `spawn_error`, byte counts, and run-relative `stdout_path` /
`stderr_path` pointers under the run's `verify/` directory; full streams are not
embedded in the journal. `spawn_error` rides the record because the record's
readers are out-of-process and `returncode` alone cannot separate a child that
never started from one that ran. That store is deliberately separate from `logs/`, which
holds coding-CLI pane captures named after session task ids and is read as such
by the TUI.

Two more context fields say **which** verification the results came from, because
nothing else on the context can: both the dev leg and the repair leg emit
`post_dev_verify` from `Phase.DEV_VERIFY`, and `ctx.attempt` is one per-story
counter the repair leg continues rather than restarts, so its value orders the
two but names neither.

| Field                       | Value                                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ctx.verification_stage`    | `"dev"` for the initial dev verification, `"fix"` for a repair one, `None` if none ran |
| `ctx.verification_sequence` | the story's 1-based ordinal for that pass, or `None` if it recorded nothing            |

Together they are the join key: the `verify-command-result` entries carrying this
`story_key` + `verification_stage` + `verification_sequence` are exactly this
context's results, one per record, ordered by `command_index`. The sequence is
monotonic per story **across a pause/resume** — unlike `attempt`, which a human
re-arm reuses — so it is safe to persist as a correlation id.

Read `ctx.command_results == ()` together with `verification_stage`; on its own it
is ambiguous:

- **`verification_stage is None`** — no verify pass ran. Several causes land here
  and the empty tuple names none of them: the session did not complete
  (`ctx.session_status`), an earlier gate already failed the attempt — the
  dev-artifact check or the deferral harvest (`ctx.verify_reason`) — or the engine
  variant suppressed the pass for this leg (stories mode skips it on a plan-halt
  leg, which has no implementation to build).
- **stage set, `verification_sequence is None`** — the pass ran and executed
  nothing, because `[verify] commands` is empty. No journal record exists either.
- **stage set, sequence an int** — those commands ran, and each has a matching
  journal record.

What lands on disk is bounded by `[verify] stream_capture_kb` (default 256 KiB per
stream): the **tail** is retained, and the record stays explicit about the cut —
`stdout_bytes` / `stderr_bytes` are what the command emitted, `stdout_captured_bytes` /
`stderr_captured_bytes` how much of that reached disk, and `stdout_truncated` /
`stderr_truncated` their inequality. Both counts are UTF-8 lengths of the decoded
stream, **not** file sizes: the files are written in text mode, so Windows newline
translation makes the file larger there. Set the knob to `0` to retain nothing at
all — no files are written and the pointers are null, but the record still lands
with the full byte counts, because "nothing was retained" and "the command was
silent" are different facts. Retaining is observation and never fails a run: if the
write raises (ENOSPC, a read-only run dir, or a `verify/` directory whose
confinement cannot be established — the store refuses rather than write through
a symlink a session planted), the pointer is null and `capture_error`
carries the reason. A plugin reading these pointers must therefore treat both
`None` and a missing file as normal, and consult `*_truncated` before assuming a
file holds a command's whole output. Treat verifier output as potentially sensitive and store, upload, sign,
or act on it only from an explicitly configured plugin.

**The dev phase is the whole of this HOOK, not of the journal.** `[verify]
commands` also run at the _review_ gate — `verify_review` /
`verify_review_stories` / `verify_review_bundle` end on the same core classifier
— and those runs **are journalled** (`verification_stage: "review"`, sharing the
story's one `verification_sequence` counter with the dev and fix passes) but are
**not published to any hook.** They run in `repo_root`, the same root
the dev phase uses (#695); only the gates' own artifact reads — the spec, the
sprint board, the deferred-work ledger — stay project-rooted. Five engine gates reach them: the
converged review pass, the review-budget-exhaustion rescue, the review-timeout
salvage, and both passes inside the skip-review commit path (which runs the gate
again after a repair). The records do not name which of the five ran — the
neighbouring `review-result` / `review-skipped*` / `review-timeout-salvage*`
entries and the sequence ordering say that. `bmad-loop confirm --reverify` runs
the commands too, out of band by construction — the run that parked the story is
finished, so there is no journal to write to and no hook bus to emit on.

Two consequences a handler has to be written for:

- **`verify-command-result` entries are a complete census of a RUN's verifier
  command invocations, but not of every gate visit or of a project's.** Every
  command executed by an in-run dev, fix or review pass lands a record. A pass
  with no `[verify] commands` configured executes nothing and therefore records
  nothing; `bmad-loop confirm --reverify` stays outside because it runs after the
  run that parked the story is over. Count distinct `verification_sequence`
  values to derive recorded passes, while preserving that zero-command caveat.
- **One command record is not a pass verdict**, and an earlier red pass is not
  evidence the commit was blocked: a failed pass can be followed by a green
  review-gate pass and a commit. Group records by `verification_sequence`, then
  correlate that group with its surrounding decision event instead of inferring
  the decision from one command or from an older pass. The dev and fix legs use
  `dev-decision` / `fix-decision`; review passes use the applicable neighbouring
  `review-result`, `review-skipped*`, `review-timeout-salvage*`,
  `review-budget-committed`, or `review-followup-damped` event described above.

The hook boundary is deliberate, not an oversight — the review leg would need its
own stage rather than a second meaning for one named `post_dev_verify` — and is
tracked as a follow-up in [#656](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/bmad-loop/issues/656),
which now narrows to that stage: the journalling half of it has landed.

None of these carries the review gate's `[verify] commands` results — that gate
journals every command it runs, stream captures included, but publishes nothing to
a hook context. See the boundary note above `### Review`.

## Workflows (`[provides]`)

A **workflow** is the conservative form of custom orchestration: an **extra agent
session** injected at a lifecycle stage, run through the engine's normal session
machinery — **no new pipeline stage**. It is the right tool when you want an
additional pass (a doc sync, a lint sweep, an extra reviewer) without rewriting
the loop.

```toml
[workflows.doc-sync]
stage = "post_dev_phase"   # injection point (see below)
role = "review"            # which adapter runs it: dev | review
prompt = "Update CHANGELOG.md for story {story_key} if it introduced user-facing changes."
blocking = false           # true: a non-completed session defers the unit
```

- **Injection stages** are deliberately limited to where the unit's worktree is
  live and the dev/review work is on disk: **`post_dev_phase`** (right after dev
  lands), **`post_review_result`** (after a review verdict — fires only when the
  orchestrator review loop actually runs; `review.trigger = "recommended"` skips
  it on stories whose dev session recommends no follow-up), and
  **`pre_commit_gate`** (unconditionally just before every commit — review, skip,
  and budget-rescue paths alike — so a session there evaluates the exact tree
  about to commit). `pre_commit_gate` is **defer-safe**: it fires before the unit
  enters COMMITTING, so a _blocking_ workflow whose session doesn't complete
  still defers cleanly. Other stages lack a worktree or run after teardown.
- **`prompt`** expands `{story_key}`, `{run_id}`, and `{scripts}`.
- **The orchestrator appends two sections to what you write**, and appends them
  _after_ the session gates fire, so a `pre_workflow_session` / `pre_session`
  prompt rewrite cannot strip them: a **`## Sprint board`** prohibition — the
  same one dev and review prompts carry, because a workflow session runs while
  the orchestrator's own `sprint-status.yaml` advance is still uncommitted and
  must not be "fixed" or reverted (#437) — and the **`## Completion signal`**
  contract naming the marker file the session must write before ending its turn.
  Write `prompt` as a self-contained instruction; do not restate either. (Stories
  mode has no board, so the first section is absent there.)
- The injected session is a **first-class session**: it fires `pre_workflow_session`
  → `pre_session` → `post_session`, is recorded on the task, and counts toward the
  token budget. Its journal entries are `workflow-start` / `workflow-end`.
- **`blocking`**: a blocking workflow whose session doesn't complete **defers the
  unit** (through the existing defer primitive). A non-blocking one is advisory.
- A workflow from a `[python]` plugin is **trust-gated** along with the module: it
  fires only when the plugin is enabled. A workflow from a pure-declarative plugin
  fires whenever the plugin is discovered.

`registry.provided_workflows()` lists declared workflow names for introspection.

### Making a workflow configurable

The `blocking` and (in effect) on/off state a workflow declares in its manifest
are **defaults**. A plugin can let an operator tune them per run — disable a step
or flip its gate — by declaring settings that follow a naming convention. No
Python is required; the registry reads the resolved settings when it injects.

The convention, keyed on the workflow's `name`:

| Setting key       | Type | Effect                                                              |
| ----------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<name>_enabled`  | bool | When explicitly `false`, the step is **dropped** — no session runs. |
| `<name>_blocking` | bool | **Overrides** the manifest's `blocking` flag for that workflow.     |

**Default semantics — absent settings change nothing.** The overlay only acts on
a setting that is present and (for `_enabled`) explicitly `false`; `_blocking`
falls back to the manifest value when unset. A plugin that declares none of these
settings is **byte-identical** to one written before the feature existed.

**Declare the matching `[[settings]]`** so the keys are first-class (typed,
documented, surfaced in the settings UI) and operators can flip them from
`[plugins.<plugin>]` in `policy.toml`:

```toml
# A gate step: generated advisory by default, an operator can make it block.
[workflows.nfr]
stage = "pre_commit_gate"
role = "review"
prompt = "Run the NFR assessment for the changes in {story_key}."
blocking = false              # manifest default: advisory

[[settings]]
key = "nfr_enabled"           # <name>_enabled  -> drop the step when false
type = "bool"
default = true
help = "Run the NFR workflow after review."

[[settings]]
key = "nfr_blocking"          # <name>_blocking -> override the blocking flag
type = "bool"
default = false
help = "Escalate the unit when the NFR gate is not satisfied."
```

An operator then opts in from policy:

```toml
[plugins.tea]
nfr_blocking = true           # flip the advisory gate to blocking
td_enabled   = false          # turn the test-design step off entirely
```

**Interaction with the blocking / defer path.** `<name>_blocking` feeds the same
`WorkflowSpec.blocking` the engine already honors: a blocking workflow whose
session does not **complete** defers the unit through the existing defer
primitive (see [Workflows](#workflows-provides) above). The overlay only changes
which value that flag holds at injection time — it adds no new control flow. (For
quality gating on a workflow's _output_ rather than its completion, do that in an
in-process `on_pre_commit` hook; the manifest `blocking` flag only checks session
completion.)

**Disabling every step at a stage is free.** When a setting turns off the last
remaining workflow at a stage, that stage drops out of `registry.workflow_stages()`
too, so the engine's O(1) per-stage injection guard skips it entirely — the same
as if no workflow had ever been declared there.

## Worked walkthrough: the `guardrails` plugin

The repo ships a complete example under
[`examples/plugins/guardrails/`](../examples/plugins/guardrails/) that exercises a
setting, an observe hook, a veto gate, a commit-message mutation, and a provided
workflow — in ~40 lines of Python plus a manifest. Build it yourself:

**1. Make the folder.** In your project:

```text
.bmad-loop/plugins/guardrails/
  plugin.toml
  guardrails.py
```

**2. Write the manifest** (`plugin.toml`): metadata, a `[python]` module, two
`[[settings]]` (`trailer`, `forbid_epic`), and one `[workflows.doc-sync]` bound to
`post_dev_phase`. Copy it from the example.

**3. Write the module** (`guardrails.py`):

```python
from bmad_loop.plugins import Plugin

class GuardrailsPlugin(Plugin):
    fail_closed = False

    def on_pre_story(self, ctx):
        # observe: count stories in the cross-stage shared dict
        ctx.shared["stories_seen"] = ctx.shared.get("stories_seen", 0) + 1

    def on_pre_dev_phase(self, ctx):
        # gate: skip a "parked" epic
        parked = int(self.settings.get("forbid_epic") or 0)
        if parked and ctx.epic == parked:
            ctx.veto("skip", f"epic {parked} is parked")

    def on_pre_commit(self, ctx):
        # mutate: append a trailer to the commit message
        trailer = str(self.settings.get("trailer") or "").strip()
        if trailer and trailer not in (ctx.proposed_commit_message or ""):
            base = (ctx.proposed_commit_message or "").rstrip()
            ctx.proposed_commit_message = f"{base}\n\n{trailer}" if base else trailer
```

**4. Enable + configure** in `.bmad-loop/policy.toml`:

```toml
[plugins]
enabled = ["guardrails"]

[plugins.guardrails]
trailer = "Automated-by: bmad-loop"
forbid_epic = 0           # set to an epic number to park it
```

**5. Run.** On the next `bmad-loop run`:

- the settings TUI shows a **guardrails** section with `trailer` + `forbid_epic`;
- each story increments `stories_seen` in the run's `plugin_shared`;
- a story in the parked epic is **skipped** before its dev session;
- after dev lands, the **doc-sync** workflow runs an extra review-role session;
- each commit message gets the **trailer** appended.

Drop `[python]` from the manifest and `guardrails` from `enabled`, and the plugin
goes completely inert — proof of the trust gate.

---

## Platform portability

bmad-loop's core is portable Python, and the OS-specific work is quarantined behind
seams (the tmux transport, the `ProcessHost` lifecycle, the hook interpreter — see
[Porting bmad-loop to a new OS](porting-to-a-new-os.md)). Plugin **helper scripts**
are spawned under the orchestrator's own interpreter (`sys.executable`), **not** a
PATH-resolved `python3` — so a bundled script may `import bmad_loop` and reach those
seams instead of re-implementing OS primitives. Follow this discipline:

- **Use the `ProcessHost` seam for pid lifecycle.** For terminate / force-kill /
  liveness, call `get_process_host()` rather than guarding `os.kill` /
  `signal.SIGKILL` / `taskkill` behind your own `sys.platform` branch:

  ```python
  from bmad_loop.process_host import get_process_host

  host = get_process_host()
  host.terminate(pid)
  if host.is_alive(pid):
      host.force_kill(pid)
  ```

  The seam already carries the POSIX and Windows behavior, so the script gains a
  new OS for free when a host registers.

- **Stay dependency-free.** Beyond `bmad_loop` itself, import only the stdlib so the
  script runs anywhere the core does. If you genuinely need a third-party package on
  one platform, make it an **optional extra** in `pyproject.toml` and **import it
  lazily** with a clear error if missing — never at module top level. The bundled
  Unity plugin does exactly this for `psutil`: imported only on non-Linux process
  _discovery_ (a core dependency on Windows, the `non-linux` extra on macOS), so the
  dep-free Linux/WSL path never pulls it in.

- **Guard the primitives that have no seam.** Anything absent or differently-shaped
  on Windows that isn't behind a seam — `cp`/`--reflink`, symlinks, `/proc` scanning,
  `/tmp`, `start_new_session` — still needs a fallback behind a `sys.platform`
  branch, with a `# portability: <reason>` comment so the intent (and the CI
  portability guard, `tests/test_portability_guard.py`) stays honest. Keep the Linux
  fast path byte-identical; the Windows branch can be best-effort and is not
  exercised until a native-Windows backend ships. WSL **is** Linux, so it takes the
  fast path unchanged.

The Unity plugin's `unity_teardown.py` is the worked example: it **delegates** its
SIGTERM→SIGKILL sweep of leaked Editor / MCP-server processes to
`get_process_host()` (so it inherits Windows behavior), while still doing its own
worktree-bound process _discovery_ via the guarded `/proc`-with-psutil-fallback
scan. See it alongside `unity_setup.py` / `unity_cleanup.py` (and the
[Game Engine plugin guide](game-engine-plugin-guide.md)) for both shapes.
