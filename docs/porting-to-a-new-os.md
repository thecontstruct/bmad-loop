# Porting bmad-loop to a new OS

bmad-loop runs on Linux and macOS today, and on Windows **via WSL** (which _is_
Linux — every fast path works unchanged). A **native** Windows host, or any other
OS, is not yet shipped. This guide is the map for adding one.

## The promise

The OS-specific work is quarantined behind four seams. Porting to a new OS is
**new files plus one registration line per seam** — no edits to the bodies of the
core `.py` modules or their call sites. Each seam selects its implementation by
platform from a registry, with an env-var override for tests.

| #   | Seam                 | Contract / registry                                            | Override env var                                        |
| --- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Terminal multiplexer | `TerminalMultiplexer` / `register_multiplexer`                 | `BMAD_LOOP_MUX_BACKEND` (or `bmad-loop mux set <name>`) |
| 2   | Process lifecycle    | `ProcessHost` / `register_process_host`                        | `BMAD_LOOP_PROCESS_HOST`                                |
| 3   | Hook interpreter     | `ProcessHost.hook_interpreter()`                               | (rides on seam 2)                                       |
| 4   | Validate preflight   | `_platform_preflight(project)` (no new code — reads seams 1–2) | —                                                       |

The **one** bundled caveat: a backend you ship _in this repo_ needs its import
added to the relevant `_load_builtin_*` loader so it self-registers (one line). An
out-of-tree backend skips even that — it registers at its own import time.

This guide covers porting **the OS axis** (transport + process lifecycle). The
orthogonal **CLI axis** — teaching bmad-loop a new coding CLI — lives in the
[adapter authoring guide](adapter-authoring-guide.md). The deep transport contract
(every method a multiplexer must implement) also lives there; this guide links to
it rather than duplicating it.

---

## Seam 1 — terminal multiplexer (transport)

**Contract:** `TerminalMultiplexer` (`src/bmad_loop/adapters/multiplexer.py`) — how
sessions, windows, and panes are created, observed, and torn down. Everything that
touches a session goes through `get_multiplexer()`; nothing else shells out to a
multiplexer directly.

**Register** at import time:

```python
from bmad_loop.adapters.multiplexer import register_multiplexer

register_multiplexer("psmux", lambda platform: platform == "win32", PsmuxMultiplexer)
```

`register_multiplexer(name, matches, factory)`:

- `name` — the key the `BMAD_LOOP_MUX_BACKEND` override selects by.
- `matches(sys.platform) -> bool` — decides automatic selection.
- `factory() -> TerminalMultiplexer` — builds the backend.

`get_multiplexer()` resolves by precedence:

1. `BMAD_LOOP_MUX_BACKEND` — forces a backend by name (per-invocation).
2. `[mux] backend` in `.bmad-loop/policy.toml` — the persisted, machine-scoped
   choice (`bmad-loop init` gitignores policy.toml, so it never reaches
   teammates). Set it with `bmad-loop mux set <name>`.
3. The **platform default** — win32: `psmux`, everywhere else: `tmux` — when
   that backend is registered _and_ `available()`.
4. The first registered backend whose `matches(sys.platform)` is true _and_
   whose `available()` reports usable (registration order breaks ties).
5. The historical fallback: first platform match regardless of availability,
   bottoming out at tmux — so a POSIX host without tmux still selects
   `TmuxMultiplexer` and `validate` reports it unavailable.

A forced name (1–2) bypasses both the platform predicate and `available()` — an
explicit choice is trusted — and fails loudly when it matches no registered
backend. Launch preflights and TUI observers share one forced-aware gate
(`mux_usable()`), which warns once on stderr when a forced backend probes
unavailable instead of silently proceeding or refusing. `bmad-loop mux` lists every registered backend with its availability,
version, and the current selection. (The result is cached — see
[Testing a port](#testing-a-port).)

### Shipping out-of-tree: the `bmad_loop.mux_backends` entry point

How does the registration snippet above ever _run_ when the backend lives in its
own package? Advertise the module in the package's `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project.entry-points."bmad_loop.mux_backends"]
psmux = "my_package.backend"
```

Before every selection, core scans that entry-point group and imports each
advertised module (builtins first, so tmux keeps first registration and the
precedence above is unchanged); the module's top-level `register_multiplexer(...)`
call does the rest. Installing the package into bmad-loop's environment — e.g.
`uv tool install bmad-loop --with <your-adapter>` — is the entire setup; no core
edit, no config step. The entry-point _value_ is a bare module path (core only
imports it; the name is just a diagnostic label).

A package that fails to import can never break selection: the failure is
recorded and reported by `bmad-loop mux` (a `warning:` line under the table) and
the `validate` preflight, and selection proceeds without it. The reference
out-of-tree adapter is
[bmad-loop-adapter-herdr](https://github.com/pbean/bmad-loop-adapter-herdr).

### Two build paths

- **Extend `BaseTmuxBackend`** (`adapters/tmux_base.py`) for a **tmux-family**
  backend. `BaseTmuxBackend` holds every argv construction and routes every spawn
  through one primitive, `_run(argv, *, check=..., env=...)`. A native-Windows
  "psmux" that speaks a tmux-like CLI sets the `_BINARY` class attribute to the
  binary it drives (every spawn, PATH probe, and in-source client verb follows
  it) and the `_ENCODING` class attribute for output decoding (e.g. `"utf-8"`),
  and passes a per-call `env=` where needed — overriding `_run()` itself only
  to tweak the timeout — plus the
  shell-dialect hooks that `new_window` / `new_parked_window` compose from
  (`_shell_wrap`, `_join_argv`, `_parked_trailer`, `_source_prefix`,
  `_window_launch` and the `_EXIT_CAPTURE`/`_ECHO`/`_PARK` fragments) —
  **without editing** `tmux_base.py` or its POSIX leaf `tmux_backend.py`
  (`TmuxMultiplexer`). The one method-body override left is `pipe_pane`, whose
  POSIX `cat >>` redirection is not behind a hook.
- **Implement `TerminalMultiplexer` fresh** when the host has no tmux-shaped CLI
  at all (e.g. a ConPTY-based window manager). You implement the full contract
  directly; `tmux_backend.py` is the reference for what each method must produce.
  The reference worked example is the external **herdr adapter**
  ([pbean/bmad-loop-adapter-herdr](https://github.com/pbean/bmad-loop-adapter-herdr),
  `src/bmad_loop_adapter_herdr/backend.py`) — a cross-platform, agent-aware
  workspace manager whose object model (workspace/tab/pane) and CLI are a
  different binary family entirely, so it subclasses nothing and maps the whole
  contract onto herdr verbs: a bmad-loop session is a herdr **workspace** (label
  == session name), a window is a **tab** (its `root_pane.pane_id` is the native
  window id), and the launched command runs via a typed `exec <argv>` so
  process-exit stays tmux-identical window death. Where herdr has no analogue
  for a contract method — options, `pipe_pane`, the parked-window return hop,
  detach — it emulates or degrades honestly (a JSON sidecar for options, a
  polling tee for `pipe_pane`, a per-window return file for the parked trailer,
  a no-op detach); that **degradation ledger** is the module docstring, and it
  is the template for what "implement fresh" costs in practice. (The
  operator-facing view of those degradations — what a herdr _user_ notices and
  does — is
  [the adapter's operator guide](https://github.com/pbean/bmad-loop-adapter-herdr/blob/main/docs/adapter-multiplexer-herdr.md).)

`available()` gates whether the backend is usable on the current host (e.g. its
binary is on PATH); the optional `version()` feeds `bmad-loop mux`, the diagnostic
dump, and the validate preflight (seam 4).

**`version()` returns one bounded line.** Every one of those consumers renders it
inline — a table row whose width sets every other row's, a finding message, a
scalar `--json` field — so a binary whose `--version` prints several lines (psmux
prints a `tmux X.Y.Z` compatibility line plus its own) folds them in the backend,
and a very long single line breaks the same surfaces a newline does. Use
`fold_version()` from `adapters/multiplexer.py`: it joins the non-blank lines with
`"; "` **in order**, caps the result at `VERSION_MAX_CHARS`, and returns `None` —
the "no version" sentinel, never `""` — for an all-blank probe. Order is
load-bearing wherever something parses the string: psmux's version gate anchors at
the first segment, and the cap only ever cuts the tail. Core applies the same fold
defensively at each consumer, so breaking the promise cannot split a `mux` row —
but fold at the source, since only the backend knows which line identifies it.

### Availability discriminators (same-platform backends)

Selection consults `available()`, so it must be a **cheap, side-effect-free
probe** — PATH lookups, plus at most one bounded version query when usability
genuinely depends on the installed version — and `factory()` must be a plain
constructor: `detect_multiplexers()` instantiates every registered backend just
to list it. When two backends claim the same platform, their `available()`
probes should be **pairwise discriminating** — otherwise both report usable and
only the platform default / registration order separates them in listings and
selection. The bundled psmux backend discriminates by construction: it drives
psmux's distinctly-named binary (`_BINARY = "psmux"`), so it never claims some
other tmux-family install that owns the `tmux` name. Its probe also
version-gates — psmux 3.3.8 or newer is required
([why](multiplexer-backends.md#psmux-native-windows-experimental)), so an old or unidentifiable
version reads as unavailable (`psmux -V` keeps the `tmux X.Y.Z` output format
deliberately):

```python
class PsmuxMultiplexer(BaseTmuxBackend):
    _BINARY = "psmux"

    def available(self) -> bool:
        if not all(shutil.which(exe) for exe in ("psmux", "pwsh")):
            return False
        reported = re.match(r"tmux (\d+)\.(\d+)(?:\.(\d+))?", self.version() or "")
        return bool(reported) and tuple(int(part or 0) for part in reported.groups()) > (3, 3, 7)

# a sibling that owns the `tmux` name (e.g. a tmux-windows port) discriminates
# against psmux explicitly:
class WindowsTmuxMultiplexer(BaseTmuxBackend):
    def available(self) -> bool:
        return shutil.which("tmux") is not None and shutil.which("psmux") is None
```

Do **not** inherit `BaseTmuxBackend.available()` (a bare `which` on `_BINARY`)
for a same-platform sibling that shares a binary name: selection would still
break the tie via the platform default, but `bmad-loop mux` and the validate
preflight would list both as available when only one actually drives the
installed binary. A host with an ambiguous install resolves it explicitly:
`bmad-loop mux set <name>`.

A backend from a **different binary family** sidesteps this problem entirely.
The external herdr adapter probes `shutil.which("herdr")` — a distinct binary
that no tmux-family backend claims — so it is **pairwise-discriminating by
construction**: it can never report available on a host where only tmux is
installed, and vice versa, without any explicit tie-break. That `available()`
must stay a pure PATH lookup (it is called by `detect_multiplexers()` on every
listing) — the herdr adapter in particular **never** probes or starts its
background server from `available()`, `version()`, or the constructor; server
autostart is lazy, confined to the mutating operations that actually need it.

### Registry namespaces (only if your transport has one)

Some multiplexers address sessions through a **registry**: a directory of
per-session addressing files that every verb resolves a target through. psmux is
one — `PSMUX_DATA_DIR`, a `.port`/`.key` set per session. tmux is not: a server
is a socket, and there is no root a caller could be pointed at.

The distinction matters because a registry is a **namespace, not a filter**. A
session in registry A is not merely hidden from a verb aimed at registry B; it is
unaddressable from it, and the transport usually reports that as an ordinary "no
such session" rather than an error. Two processes that disagree about the root
therefore disagree about which sessions exist — and the verbs that carry that
disagreement (`has_session`, `list_window_ids`) are exactly the ones whose seam
contract says to degrade quietly.

If your transport namespaces, four rules:

- **Derive the root from the project**, never from the run, never from the
  launching shell, and never from anything a driven session can write
  (`policy.toml` and the project tree are both session-writable). bmad-loop's is
  `runs.mux_registry_root` — `<state root>/<project key>/_mux`, reusing
  `runs.project_tag` so two spellings of one project cannot key two registries.
  The derivation belongs in `runs`, beside the state root, not in the backend.
- **Bind it once, ahead of every spawn.** `cli._configure_mux` exports it before
  dispatch — the last point that still knows the project and the first that
  precedes every verb. A create-call-only injection is worse than doing nothing.
  An ambient value needs a real question answered, not a flag. A multiplexer
  hands every pane child the server's environment, so an ambient value there was
  inherited rather than typed — and a process cannot tell an inherited one from a
  typed one, nor a value typed in one shell from one a profile exports into every
  shell. Those want opposite answers, so do not try to decide between them: derive
  unconditionally, override what you find, and report that you did. A derived root
  is a pure function of (project, state root), so every process agrees without
  anything having to travel between them, which is the property worth protecting.
- **Carry `new_window`'s env inside the command you launch**, not in the
  environment you hope the pane inherits. A multiplexer is free not to hand a
  pane child the server's environment (psmux's `PSMUX_BARE_ENV=1` mode clears
  it to a 14-name allowlist — a mode bmad-loop declares unsupported and warns
  about, precisely because the _other_ windows ride inheritance); an env dict a
  caller passed explicitly must survive regardless, and an in-command transport
  is the one that does. `_window_launch` is the dialect hook that owns each
  family dialect's answer.
- **Answer `has_registry_namespace()`, `registry_root()` and
  `legacy_registries()`.** The first tells cleanup your transport namespaces
  sessions at all, so a registry with no root in force reads as the shared
  default it is rather than as proof of ownership. The second lets
  `bmad-loop mux` disclose the root, so an operator's own client is not silently
  looking at an empty registry. The third hands cleanup instances bound to roots
  your sessions may predate; each must be an independent instance, never a global
  environment swap, because the sweep runs on a TUI worker thread beside other
  threads issuing ordinary verbs.

All three default to "no namespace" on `TerminalMultiplexer`, so a transport
without one inherits the right answers and writes no code.

author](adapter-authoring-guide.md#the-transport-contract-for-a-backend-author).

## Seam 2 — process lifecycle (`ProcessHost`)

**Contract:** `ProcessHost` (`src/bmad_loop/process_host.py`) — the four pid
operations the orchestrator needs (`runs.stop_run`, the TUI liveness column), plus
the hook interpreter (seam 3). On POSIX these are `os.kill` calls; on Windows
`taskkill` / psutil. `WindowsProcessHost` already ships (unexercised until a
Windows backend lands).

**Register** like the multiplexer:

```python
from bmad_loop.process_host import register_process_host

register_process_host("windows", lambda platform: platform == "win32", WindowsProcessHost)
```

`get_process_host()` selects by the same rule as `get_multiplexer()`;
`BMAD_LOOP_PROCESS_HOST` forces one by name; POSIX is the default fallback.

**Implement:**

- `terminate(pid)` — politely stop it (POSIX `SIGTERM` / Windows `taskkill`). Raise
  the `OSError` family (`ProcessLookupError` / `PermissionError`) so callers keep
  their "already gone / not ours" handling. This is the polite fast path, not the
  stop guarantee: `bmad-loop stop` also lodges a hard `stop-request.json` the engine
  reads itself, so a port whose `terminate` cannot actually be delivered still stops
  runs (#319).
- `force_kill(pid)` — escalation when `terminate` is ignored (POSIX `SIGKILL` /
  Windows `taskkill /F /T`). Only ever called once identity is confirmed.
- `is_alive(pid)` — read-only liveness probe, no signal sent.
- `identity(pid) -> float | None` — the **PID-reuse guard**: a value that stays
  constant for the life of `pid` but changes if the pid is reused (Linux reads
  `/proc/<pid>/stat` start-time; elsewhere psutil's `create_time()`). Return
  `None` where the platform can't provide one — callers then **refuse to
  force-kill** rather than risk an unrelated process that inherited the pid.
- `hook_interpreter()` — seam 3, below.

---

## Seam 3 — hook interpreter

`ProcessHost.hook_interpreter()` is the command prefix that `install` / `probe`
interpolate into the hook registrations they write (the script path and canonical
event are appended by the caller). It exists so hook registration never branches
on `sys.platform` at the call site:

- POSIX returns `"python3"` (the interpreter on PATH).
- `WindowsProcessHost` returns `"uv run --no-project python"` — Windows ships no
  `python3` launcher, and `--no-project` resolves an interpreter without activating
  a project venv (hooks fire detached).

A new OS overrides this on its `ProcessHost`; nothing else changes.

---

## Seam 4 — validate preflight

`_platform_preflight(project)` (`src/bmad_loop/cli.py`, called from `cmd_validate`)
asks the selected multiplexer for its `available()` / `version()` and names the
selected process host. A new OS therefore surfaces its readiness in `bmad-loop
validate` **by registering** (seams 1–2) — not by adding a `win32` block to
`validate`. The process host is named in the output so a misselection (e.g. the
Windows host picked on Linux) is visible at a glance.

There is no new code to write for this seam — it reads seams 1 and 2.

The one `sys.platform` branch that does live here is not a port seam and is not a
precedent for one: the `host.win32-on-wsl-path` check (#332) reports that the _interpreter
itself_ is the wrong build for the shell that launched it — a native-Windows
`bmad-loop` reached from a WSL prompt. No registration can express that, because
every seam is correctly selected for the interpreter that is running; what is wrong
is which interpreter the operator got. Readiness questions still register.

---

## Helper scripts (plugins)

Plugin **helper scripts** (e.g. the bundled Unity plugin's `unity_setup.py` /
`unity_teardown.py`) are spawned under the orchestrator's own interpreter via
`sys.executable`, **not** a PATH-resolved `python3`. The practical consequence: a
bundled helper script may `import bmad_loop` — so for pid lifecycle it should
**use the seam** rather than re-implement kill/liveness behind its own
`sys.platform` guards:

```python
from bmad_loop.process_host import get_process_host

host = get_process_host()
host.terminate(pid)
if host.is_alive(pid):
    host.force_kill(pid)
```

**Worked example:** `data/plugins/unity/unity_teardown.py` now _delegates_ its
SIGTERM→SIGKILL sweep of leaked Editor / MCP-server processes to
`get_process_host()` instead of calling `os.kill` / `signal.SIGKILL` itself — so it
gains Windows behavior for free when a Windows host registers. (It still does its
own worktree-bound process _discovery_ via `/proc` with a psutil fallback, because
discovery has no seam — see the next section.)

> Out-of-tree plugin scripts distributed outside this repo can't assume `bmad_loop`
> is importable in every install; the import path is reliable for **bundled**
> scripts spawned under `sys.executable`.

---

## The portability guard

`tests/test_portability_guard.py` AST-scans `src/bmad_loop` and fails CI if a new
hard POSIX dependency creeps in outside an allowlist — a `["tmux", …]` argv outside
the tmux backend, a bare `os.kill(pid, 0)` outside the liveness helpers, an
unguarded `signal.SIGKILL`, a hardcoded `/tmp` / `/proc` / `/dev/null`,
`start_new_session=True`, or `shell=True`. When you add a seam, route the OS call
**through** it rather than widening an allowlist; the few sanctioned exceptions
(the quarantine files, the platform-guarded discovery helpers) carry a
`# portability:` ack on the line.

Things **without** a seam still need a hand-guarded fallback behind a
`sys.platform` branch with that ack: `cp --reflink` / CoW copies, symlinks,
`/proc` scanning, `/tmp`, and `start_new_session`. Keep the Linux fast path
byte-identical; the new-OS branch can be best-effort until exercised.

---

## Path predicates — the guard family a port must not relax

`src/bmad_loop/platform_util.py` carries four predicates that every "this config
value must be a path inside the project" guard is built from. They are
**platform-independent by construction**: each answers the same way on every host,
because a config file must not mean different things depending on where the run
happens.

- `is_absolute_path(value)` — rooted or drive-qualified in _either_ flavour:
  `/etc/passwd`, `C:\x`, `\\server\share`, and the drive-_relative_ `C:foo`.
- `has_parent_ref(value)` — a `..` segment in either flavour.
- `names_tree_root(value)` — names the tree itself rather than anything inside it:
  `""`, `"."`, and the all-periods-and-spaces spellings Win32 trims to nothing
  (`". "`, `"..."`, `"   "`).
- `names_win32_alias(value)` — the determinism member. The other three refuse a value
  that _escapes_ the tree; this one refuses a value that stays inside it and still
  names a **different** path on Windows: a reserved device basename (`NUL`,
  `aux.json`, `CON .txt`), a component whose trailing periods and spaces Win32
  strips (`.claude/skills.`), or a component of _nothing but_ periods and spaces
  sitting beside a real one (`sub/...` — Win32 empties it and the value addresses
  `sub`).

What a porter needs to know:

- **Do not make any of them consult `sys.platform`.** A value refused here is refused
  everywhere, deliberately — `skill_tree = "NUL"` is rejected on Linux for the same
  reason `C:\secrets` is. The alternative turns a `seed_files` entry into a
  build-number question, since Windows 11 narrowed the device rule and Windows 10 did
  not.
- **They refuse disjoint spelling classes, and that is load-bearing.**
  `names_tree_root` carves out `..` for `has_parent_ref`; `names_win32_alias` carves
  out a _value_ made entirely of period/space components for `names_tree_root` (a
  single such component beside a real one stays its own — it aliases its parent, not
  the root) and the `.`/`..` components for their owners. Those carve-outs are what
  let each predicate be ablated on its own — a "simplification" that merges them
  costs the suite its ability to say which rule fired.
- **`_is_reserved_basename` is a _segment_ predicate**, blind to `sub/NUL`: it splits
  on the first dot of the whole string. Apply it per component, after splitting on
  both separators, or it silently answers False.
- **`safe_segment` is not one of them.** It maps `/` to `_`, so it sanitizes a single
  name (a run id, a sweep bundle name) and must never be applied to a multi-segment
  config path.
- **Their Win32 half is cited, not measured** — CI's legs are Linux and nothing here
  calls a Win32 API. A native-Windows port is the first chance to measure it; the
  docstrings carry their sources (Microsoft, Wine's ntdll path conformance tests,
  Project Zero) so a disagreement can be settled rather than argued.
- `src/bmad_loop/data/plugins/unity/unity_seed_assets.py` re-implements all four by
  hand: it is deployed into a consumer project, is stdlib-only, and is excluded from
  pyright. Its only drift guard is the parity suite in
  `tests/test_unity_scene_guard.py`. Mirror any change there too.

---

## Testing a port

Both `get_multiplexer()` and `get_process_host()` are `lru_cache`d, and selection
keys off `sys.platform`. To exercise a not-yet-default backend on your dev box:

| To force…      | Set                              | Then clear the cache             |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| a multiplexer  | `BMAD_LOOP_MUX_BACKEND=psmux`    | `get_multiplexer.cache_clear()`  |
| a process host | `BMAD_LOOP_PROCESS_HOST=windows` | `get_process_host.cache_clear()` |

The env var picks the registered backend by `name`; `cache_clear()` is required
because the first call memoizes the selection for the process. To make a
multiplexer choice stick across invocations instead, persist it with
`bmad-loop mux set <name>` (writes `[mux] backend` into the machine-local
policy.toml; the env var still outranks it, and `configure_multiplexer` /
`register_multiplexer` clear the cache themselves).

---

## What a native-Windows port costs, end to end

Concretely, a native-Windows port is:

1. `PsmuxMultiplexer(BaseTmuxBackend)` (or a fresh `TerminalMultiplexer`) +
   its `register_multiplexer("psmux", …)`.
2. `WindowsProcessHost` — **already shipped** — needs only its registration, which
   is **already present** in `_load_builtin_hosts`. Its `hook_interpreter()`
   (`uv run --no-project python`) is in place too.
3. A CI runner on Windows to exercise the above.

No edits to the adapters, `runs.py`, `tui/launch.py`, `probe.py`, `tui/data.py`,
`cli.py`'s `validate`, or the POSIX seam bodies. The remaining design questions
(what hosts the windows, how attach/detach and the parked exit-status window map
without a POSIX shell, the Windows-Unity cache-path follow-up) are tracked in
[the roadmap](ROADMAP.md#native-windows-multiplexer-backend).
