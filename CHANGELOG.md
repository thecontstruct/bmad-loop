# Changelog

All notable changes to `bmad-loop` are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). While the project is pre-1.0,
breaking changes may land in a minor release.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Review-gate verify commands are journalled** (#656, partial). The three review gates
  (`verify_review`, `verify_review_stories`, `verify_review_bundle`) now emit one
  `verify-command-result` per command, `verification_stage: "review"`, sharing the story's
  `verification_sequence` with its dev and fix passes and writing the same `verify/` stream
  files. `post_dev_verify` stays dev/fix only — #656 narrows to the hook stage. A gate that
  refuses before reaching its commands records nothing.

- **Portability guard: `verify_commands_outcome` is callable only from
  `verify._verify_review_commands`.** A fourth review gate composing run+classify itself would
  reintroduce #695's project-vs-repo root split; the guard now fails and names the file and
  line. Deliberately not widened to `run_verify_commands`, which has three legitimate callers
  on two roots.

- **`repo_root` in run `state.json`** (#716). A run records the git root its code work happens in,
  so an out-of-process reader — `bmad-loop resolve`'s re-arm — uses the tree the run measured
  instead of re-deriving one. A `state.json` written before the field existed degrades to the
  project directory, which is the pre-upgrade behavior.

- **Atomic writers gain an opt-in `require_writable_target` refusal** (#597). Callers over
  operator-curated files can ask for the `PermissionError` a plain `Path.write_text` used to
  raise on a read-only target. Off by default — what the other callers do today is a
  compatibility contract. The probe opens non-blocking, so a planted reader-less FIFO cannot
  park the orchestrator.

- **`bmad-loop sweep --archive`** moves closed (`status: done <ISO date>`) deferred-work entries to
  a sibling `deferred-work-archive.md`, replacing each with a stub that preserves the DW- id for
  grep and `closes_deferred` cross-references plus the load-bearing field lines (`gate:`,
  `origin:`/`source_spec:`, reopenable-close undo markers). The live ledger then carries open
  entries in full and archived ones as compact stubs, rather than every closed body forever.
  Supports `--before DATE` to archive only entries closed before a cutoff, and `--dry-run` to
  preview. Reopening an archived stub leaves an `archived-body:` line pointing at the archive
  block that holds its body. Refuses while any engine run is live. Pure deterministic Python —
  no LLM involvement.

- **Batched deferred-work ledger primitives** (#286, #469). `append_entries`,
  `mark_open_many`, `record_decision` and `mark_done_many`'s per-id `notes=` each collapse a
  sequence that used to be one write per row — or one write per half of an append-then-close
  pair — into a single read-modify-write. Each is byte-identical to the serial sequence it
  replaces, validating the whole batch before it takes the lock, minting sequential ids and
  deduplicating in-call twins exactly as the loop it stands in for did, so a caller adopting one
  changes how many windows it leaves open and nothing else. `append_entries_published`
  additionally hands back the text it wrote, so a caller that has to record what it published —
  rather than what the file happens to hold afterwards — takes its anchor from inside the hold
  instead of reading the ledger back once the lock is gone. An empty batch takes no lock at
  all, matching the per-id loop it replaces, so a caller that batches nothing cannot begin
  failing on a lock it never needed.

### Changed

- **A story's `verification_sequence` now numbers its review passes too**, so the ordinals a
  `post_dev_verify` handler receives shift: for an unchanged run whose review gate sits between
  the dev and repair legs, the `fix` pass moves from 2 to 3. The ordinal was always documented
  as a per-story counter across a run's verify passes rather than a per-leg one, and the review
  passes are now among them — but a plugin that hardcoded the numbers, rather than joining on
  the `verification_sequence` its context hands it, will read the wrong records.

- **The `verify-command-result` census inverts its meaning.** It was "the dev-phase passes only,
  never a complete count"; it is now every in-run pass — dev, fix and review — with only
  `bmad-loop confirm --reverify` outside it (and a pass with no `[verify] commands` configured,
  which records nothing because nothing ran). A run therefore retains one record set plus a
  `verify/` stream file pair per command per review pass where the review leg previously
  retained none, so `verify/` grows with the review budget on a story that loops.

- **psmux sessions now live in a per-project registry** (#537). bmad-loop points
  `PSMUX_DATA_DIR` at `<state root>/<project>/_mux`, so a prune in one project cannot address
  another's servers at all. A bare `psmux ls` no longer shows them — `bmad-loop mux` prints the
  root and the export that does. The `bmad-loop-ctl` control session becomes one per project —
  named `bmad-loop-ctl-<registry digest>` on psmux, whose duplicate-server mutex is keyed on the
  session name across every registry in a login session (a fixed name would fail every project's
  launch but the first);
  unchanged on tmux —
  and `cleanup` also sweeps the old default registry for tagged pre-upgrade sessions, naming
  whatever it still holds afterwards. The root is always derived: an ambient `PSMUX_DATA_DIR` is
  overridden — reported once on stderr, and left alone for your own psmux sessions — because
  honouring it would make the registry a function of the shell a command started in. Coding-CLI
  windows are told the state root through their env; other windows inherit it as before, and
  psmux's `PSMUX_BARE_ENV=1` — which breaks that inheritance — is declared unsupported and warned
  about once per process. Cleanup demands the project tag
  whenever the registry it addresses is not one bmad-loop derived, a shared default registry
  included. The multiplexer seam signatures are unchanged; a backend built against them keeps
  working.

- **`bmad-loop diagnose` routes the re-arm records by field name** (#640, #716). `spec_file` and
  `overwritten` are aliased, and `repo` is dropped — an absolute host path that correlates nothing.
  Routing is by field name across every entry rather than by kind, so no existing run's dump changes
  shape and `SCHEMA_VERSION` is unaffected.

- **`bmad-loop diagnose`'s default report shows the split code root and the task generation**
  (#705, #716). Both fields reached `--json` but not the markdown renderer, which samples its fields
  by hand — so the two conditions they exist to name were legible only to whoever thought to ask for
  JSON. They render as a `code root differs from project` yes/no line and a `gen` column beside
  `att`; the code root's path itself still never renders.

- **`resolve` and the TUI's re-arm aim the code root before they re-arm, not after** (#716). Both
  surfaces re-armed and THEN resumed, so resume's `repo_root` re-stamp landed after the re-arm had
  already read the stale mirror out of process: a `repo_root:` edit made while a run was paused
  advanced the attempt baseline in the tree the run had left, while the engine that resumed measured
  in the new one, with no error anywhere. Both now re-stamp through one shared writer, after the
  confirm — so a cancelled resolve still leaves the divergence for `resume` to report — and each
  warns that the run has changed repositories. A config this process cannot read degrades to the
  root the run recorded, and says so. The #414 isolation refusal is hoisted alongside it, ahead of
  both writes: under `isolation = "worktree"` beside a `repo_root` override, both surfaces used to
  re-stamp, advance the attempt baseline and report "re-armed" before resume refused the
  configuration — spending an escalation `resolve` could no longer re-run, since the story was no
  longer escalated.

- **Re-arm refuses a story spec it cannot re-open, instead of re-driving onto a status the session
  cannot route** (#640). A spec carrying no top-level `status:` failed the flip silently: the
  operator was told "re-armed <story>", the run resumed in the same gesture, and the re-driven
  session halted on `unrecognized status in existing story file`, spending the escalation. The skip
  record now aborts the re-arm, leaving the escalation armed for a corrected spec, the run state
  untouched and the spec byte-identical. Narrowed to the spec the re-drive will actually READ — an
  unreachable path only warns, since the re-drive mounts a fresh worktree and reads the committed
  spec regardless.

- **Re-arm writes the spec the run actually used, and reports every write it could not make**
  (#640). `StoryTask` persists `spec_file` relative to the worktree and re-arm resolved it against
  the process cwd, where the main checkout carries the same layout — so the status flip and the
  baseline re-stamp landed on the WRONG file while the worktree's real spec kept the escalated
  attempt's sha. The recorded path is now re-anchored on the worktree before either write.
  Separately, both frontmatter writers answer a spec they cannot move with `False` rather than an
  exception and those returns were discarded; they now journal `rearm-baseline-restamp-skipped` and
  `rearm-spec-flip-skipped`, on genuine failure only — re-arm reads the status back, so an ordinary
  second re-arm is no longer told its spec "could not be re-opened". The skip record no longer nests
  behind a successful git advance.

- **Re-arm warns when its spec writes cannot reach the re-drive** (#640). Under worktree isolation
  the status flip and baseline re-stamp land in a worktree the re-drive discards before reading it,
  and the re-driven session reads the COMMITTED spec — so a correction left only in the working tree
  is silently lost. Re-arm journals `rearm-spec-write-unreachable` and both surfaces tell the
  operator to commit the corrected spec. It is raised only when the committed spec does not already
  carry the status the re-drive needs; gating on isolation alone fired on every isolated re-arm,
  where the advice is a no-op. That proof is read at the run's pinned target branch — the ref the
  replacement worktree is cut from — not at the code root's current `HEAD`, which parts company with
  it the moment an operator checks out another branch while the run is paused; the record carries
  the branch so the remedy names the tree the re-drive will actually read. This record alone also
  HOLDS the resume both surfaces fold in behind
  the re-arm, since its advice is unactionable once the run has resumed, and `--resume` does not
  override the hold — the re-arm stands, and `bmad-loop resume <run-id>` picks the story up once the
  fix is committed.

- **The re-arm baseline records reach the TUI operator too** (#640). Each surface carried its own
  copy of the journal-kind → message routing and they had drifted: the TUI printed only
  `re-armed <key>` and handled three kinds to `resolve`'s six, silently dropping the whole
  `stale-restore-*` family — including the commits warning that is the only notice telling a human
  to inspect the tree. Both now route through one table (`runs.rearm_event_notice`), raise the same
  warnings before resuming, and agree on the ABORT path. Both read the journal through one shared
  guard, so a corrupt journal costs the echo and never the gesture. The TUI omits the trailing
  "before resuming" imperative, since it resumes in the same gesture.

- **`bmad-loop resolve` re-stamps the spec's `baseline_revision` on both re-drive legs** (#640),
  not only on a patch-restore. A from-scratch re-drive carried the escalated attempt's sha until
  step-03 re-stamped it, so every gate reading a claimed baseline before then read a stale one. The
  trade is recorded rather than hidden: a claim that genuinely diverged is journalled
  (`rearm-baseline-restamped`) instead of being silently normalized, and a re-stamp is refused
  outright when the baseline advance failed, so spec and task can never agree on a stale sha. The
  record compares against the baseline the run RECORDED, so it fires only on a claim the run never
  made. That refusal now also puts the spec back, as does the abort a failing `## Auto Run Result`
  strip raises: those are the two that fire after the status flip has landed — the rest are
  sequenced ahead of every write — so a spec carrying a movable `status:` beside an unmovable
  `baseline_revision:`, or one whose strip could not be written, used to come back flipped while
  the run still called the story escalated. A restore that itself fails raises rather than
  degrading.

- **A published run archive now lands at mode `0600`** instead of a umask-derived mode (#591).
  It is staged through a file the orchestrator creates itself rather than one `tarfile` opens
  by name, so it inherits the private mode the rest of the `.bmad-loop` write path uses.
- **A read-only operator file is refused again instead of being rewritten** (#597).
  `os.replace` needs write permission on the parent _directory_, never on the entry it
  replaces, so marking `sprint-status.yaml`, `policy.toml`, a hook `settings.json`, a story
  spec, a park record or the decisions store read-only stopped meaning anything once those
  writes became atomic. Their writers now refuse with the `PermissionError` a plain
  `write_text` used to raise. Machine-minted state (run archives, stop requests, the
  config-digest stamp) is unaffected.
- **Document the qualified-id obligation once for adapter authors (#311).** The authoring guide
  states the rule a native-id backend must follow rather than leaving it to be inferred from
  psmux's per-seam specifics, and `TerminalMultiplexer.new_parked_window` now says its id is
  opaque and MAY be qualified, matching `new_window`. Documentation only; no behavior change.
- **A config path component that names a Windows device, or ends in a period or space, is
  refused at load** (#480). Values that were accepted before — `skill_tree = "NUL"`, a
  `seed_files` entry of `aux.json`, a `worktree_seed` of `.claude/skills.` — now raise at all
  seven validation sites: `scm.worktree_seed`, an adapter's `hooks.config_path` / `skill_tree` /
  `seed_files`, a plugin's `seed_files` / `seed_globs` and `[python] module`, and the Unity
  seeder's guard dir. Such a component names a _different_ path on Windows than the one it
  spells — a device rather than a file, or a sibling once Win32 strips the trailing run — so the
  file that gets seeded and the exclude pattern rendered from the authored spelling disagree
  about which path they mean. The refusal is cross-platform on purpose, matching how the family
  already rejects `C:\secrets` on POSIX: a config value must not mean one thing per host. A
  component of only periods and spaces embedded beside a real one (`sub/...`) is refused by the
  same rule — Win32 empties it and the value addresses `sub` — and the Unity seeder and a
  plugin's `[python] module` validate the authored value rather than a `.strip()`-normalized
  copy, so an authored trailing space is refused like at every other site instead of silently
  trimmed. No shipped profile,
  bundled `plugin.toml` or default trips it, but this is a compatibility break on
  previously-loading config.

### Fixed

- Emit `diagnose --json` v2, replacing journal `patch` / `stashed_to` paths with
  `patch_present` / `stashed_to_present`, and silently degrade Git stale-commit probe
  failures while propagating non-Git faults.
- Prevent escalated sweep restarts from reusing abandoned session ids, and clear stale
  `escalation.json` artifacts when either adapter reuses a task directory.
- Route interactive resolve task ids through the shared whole-composition sanitizer while
  preserving generation-zero ids for clean story keys.
- A verify command whose child cannot be started pauses the run instead of crashing it. Any
  spawn-time `OSError` — most often a working directory that is missing, is a regular file, or
  cannot be searched, but a missing shell or EMFILE too — raised out of `subprocess.run` past
  every guard and ended the run with `crash.txt` + `state.crashed`. It is now translated into
  one `CommandResult` per command carrying a `spawn_error` (and a synthetic return code outside
  the range a signal-killed child reports, distinct from the timeout leg's `-1`), classified as
  an environment fault, and escalated — budget untouched, re-armable.
  `bmad-loop confirm --reverify` reports it as a refusal too. A command that merely times out
  is unchanged: still an ordinary fixable retry.
- Require a dispatch-time expectation before an `awaiting-operator` park skips proof-of-work,
  so a re-drive cannot verify green by inheriting an earlier in-run park; inherited parks with
  real changes still pass (#335, #676). Journal each waived artifact-gate pass as
  `park-proof-of-work-skipped`, with `zero_diff` reporting no non-excluded residue (`true`),
  residue (`false`), or an unanswerable probe (`null`). The record does not mean the park
  committed; use the later `story-awaiting-operator` event for that. Cross-run, out-of-band,
  and re-armed parks remain deferred. On upgrade, an in-flight legacy park defaults ineligible
  and may retry; re-running the story is sufficient.
- Anchor the TUI's paused-spec read and its `Request replan` write on the tree the run
  owns. Under isolation both resolved against the main checkout, so the review modals
  showed that copy of the spec and the replan reset it — reporting success while the run's
  real spec kept its terminal status, so the next dispatch did not re-plan.
- Anchor a spec's confinement root on a tree that can actually contain it, so the status
  flip, the result strip and the baseline re-stamp no longer fall back to an unguarded
  write, and the re-arm's undo no longer fails outright.
- Re-anchor spec ownership and the attempt baseline before a discarded worktree is dropped,
  in both the engine and sweep. A later resume could otherwise probe the main checkout —
  deleting untracked files the operator already had, or restoring a dead attempt's spec
  over their own copy.
- Release spec ownership when a half-built worktree is discarded for a restart, so the
  replacement mount can bind the spec. The attempt's binding is cleared and the accepted
  spec returns to its mount-relative spelling; left absolute into the deleted tree it
  resolved to nothing, and the restarted attempt ran unbound with the repair prompt naming
  a path that no longer existed.
- Release a mount's state when a resumed run stops treating it as isolated. Flipping
  `[scm] isolation` to `none` left the re-anchored spec absolute inside a mount the resume
  neither reopens nor discards, so the in-place attempt ran unbound; worse, it carried the
  unit's `baseline_commit`/`baseline_untracked` into an in-place rollback of the main
  checkout, where a unit's empty untracked snapshot marks every untracked file in the
  operator's own tree as attempt debris — deleted outright under an auto-recovering cause.
  The task also stops CLAIMING the mount: `worktree_path` doubles as the record of which
  tree owns a task's persisted state, so keeping it set made the spec and stories-root
  helpers answer for the unit while execution used the project checkout. Every
  non-isolated leg releases, not only the restart: the spec-approval, recorded-result and
  commit-finalizer continuations each finish their work and return without ever reaching
  it, so they went on consuming a spec absolutized into the orphan. The directory itself is
  left standing and the orphan is journaled, and a later flip back to `worktree` now
  reclaims it — the mount path is deterministic, so the leftover checkout made that second
  flip fail outright. The shared run branch is spared by the reclaim, keeping the commits
  earlier units landed on it.
- Fall back to the project when a task's recorded worktree is gone. Successful integration
  retires a task without clearing `worktree_path`, so the TUI's story-checkpoint card
  looked for `stories.yaml` under a deleted mount and lost the committed story's title and
  description.
- Tell the resolve session where an unreachable correction has to land. `context.json` now
  carries `redrive_base_ref` beside the reachability verdict, and the skill spells out that
  committing from the main checkout cannot include a file in a linked worktree and that the
  unit's own branch is not what the replacement mount is cut from.
- Locate the stories folder from the workspace root rather than from the spec's confinement
  root, so one modal can no longer read its spec from the run's tree and its sentinel from
  the project.
- Anchor pause notifications and the `checkpoint-pause` journal on the run's tree, sprint
  mode included. The dev-session prompt keeps the raw path — that session runs in the mount.
- Keep the dashboard up on a spec that is absent or undecodable: an absent spec reads as an
  explicit read failure rather than an empty body, and a bad byte degrades in place instead
  of losing the document.
- Refuse `Re-arm & resume` on a spec that could not be read, and report its blocking
  condition as unknown rather than absent. `Resolve` stays offered — it writes nothing and
  is what repairs a bad anchor.
- Report in `context.json` whether an edit to the spec survives to the re-drive, and teach
  the resolve skill to act on it: under isolation the mount is discarded first, so an edit
  to a worktree-local spec is lost unless it is committed.
- Decide whether the re-drive will run isolated from live policy instead of from the mount
  the escalated attempt recorded. `resolve` builds `context.json` in a separate process
  before the resume, so editing `[scm] isolation` while a story sat escalated made its
  advice wrong in opposite directions: switched to `none`, the session was told to commit
  the correction on the run's pinned branch, which an in-place re-drive never reads;
  switched to `worktree`, it was told a working-tree edit was safe when the replacement
  mount reads only committed content. The re-arm's unreachable-write record now says which
  of the two remedies applies, and the resolve skill spells out that a `HEAD` base means
  re-applying the correction in the main checkout rather than committing it anywhere. The
  TUI's re-arm refuses when `policy.toml` cannot be read rather than guessing a mode — a
  re-arm consumes the escalation, so a wrong guess is unrecoverable.
- Hold a re-armed SENTINEL until its upstream correction reaches the re-drive. A
  pre-planning sentinel is cleared by deletion, so that arm dropped the spec and returned
  before the reachability gate the status-flip arm runs — no gate was ever computed for it.
  The correction that stops the sentinel recurring is upstream (`SPEC.md` / `stories.yaml`,
  where the resolve skill sends the agent instead of the sentinel), and an isolated re-drive
  re-plans from the committed tree of a fresh mount, so an uncommitted upstream edit was
  invisible and the re-plan minted the same sentinel again, spending the escalation. The
  re-arm now records `rearm-upstream-write-unreachable`, names the folder and the branch to
  commit on, and stops the re-arm-and-resume gesture. Narrowed by proof rather than by
  configuration: the record fires only while the ref the re-drive mounts from does not
  already hold this checkout's copy of those two files, so a correction already committed
  there resumes in one gesture as before. An in-place re-drive never records — it reads the
  main checkout, which is where the resolve session runs.
- Re-read `[scm] isolation` after the interactive resolve session, before the re-arm.
  `resolve` loaded policy, then blocked on a human conversation of unbounded length, then
  keyed the re-arm on that stale answer while the engine it arms re-read policy for itself.
  Editing isolation while the agent was open therefore split the two readers: `none` to
  `worktree` re-armed treating the main-checkout correction as reachable, emitted no hold,
  then mounted a fresh worktree cut from git that could not see it. A change across the
  session is now reported on stderr.

- **`resume` re-stamps the run's recorded code root** (#716). Resume arms the engine against the
  `repo_root` it re-reads from `_bmad/bmm/config.yaml` but left the `state.json` copy at its launch
  value, so after an edit the engine worked in one tree while the out-of-process re-arm advanced the
  attempt baseline in the other, with no error on either side. The mirror now follows the paths
  resume adopts, and a move is announced rather than silent — the baselines, preserve refs and
  branches already recorded name objects in the previous tree. A `state.json` from before the field
  existed migrates without being reported as a move.

- **The unreachable-spec-write warning no longer fires on a shared artifact directory** (#640). An
  artifact directory configured outside the project is left where it is by `ProjectPaths.rebased`,
  shared across checkouts instead of rebased onto each worktree — so the flip lands on the one file
  every re-drive reads and there was never anything to commit, yet that layout took the warning on
  every re-arm with a remedy naming a file outside the repository. Containment is decided on the
  canonical paths, so a spec spelled out of but resolving back into the worktree still warns, as
  does one the host cannot canonicalize.

- **`bmad-loop resolve` still reports abandoned-restore residue when the re-arm aborts** (#640).
  The residue is journalled before the re-stamp that can raise, so an abort discarded records
  already written — including the commits warning. The echo now runs on both paths.

- **A YAML boolean in a spec's baseline key no longer refuses the attempt** (#716). `no`, `off`,
  `yes` and `on` parse as booleans, and the shared reader stringified them into `"False"`/`"True"` —
  non-empty, so they were judged as a claimed sha and outranked a `baseline_commit` naming the
  correct commit. Booleans are now treated as absent, exactly as a YAML null already was.

- **A dev RETRY now notifies the operator, with the reason** (#640). RETRY was the only dev outcome
  that REJECTS an attempt without raising a notice, and it is the one that discards a completed
  implementation. The reason lived only in the `dev-decision` journal line, so a run could spend its
  whole attempt budget throwing finished work away with nothing but the eventual exhaustion notice
  reaching a human. The notice carries the reason's first line, capped and marked with `[…]` when
  trimmed; the untruncated text stays in the journal. It can repeat for one attempt if the host dies
  between the notice and the rollback.

- **A stale `baseline_commit` no longer outranks the fresh `baseline_revision` a spec claims**
  (#716). Both consumers of a claimed dev baseline ranked the legacy key first — and `bmad-loop
resolve` manufactures exactly that dual-key spec, inserting `baseline_revision` while never
  removing a pre-existing `baseline_commit`, so the gate judged the leftover and failed an attempt
  that had done everything right. One shared reader (`frontmatter.auto_dev_baseline_of`) now backs
  both: `baseline_revision` wins whenever it is non-empty, `baseline_commit` remains the
  backward-compatible fallback, and an empty or YAML-null value on either key reads as absent.

- **The dev proof-of-work gate measures the tree the baseline was written in** (#716). Under an
  explicit `repo_root:` with `isolation = "none"` the baseline is stamped in the git root, but every
  gate probe — the commit-identity lookup, both ancestry checks and `has_changes_since` — asked the
  BMAD project directory about it, so a marker only the project tree held satisfied proof of work
  and a correct attempt was refused forever. The four probes now share the git root, and so do the
  three exclude sources that feed them. `artifact_relpaths` is deliberately untouched: it has no
  production caller, and rollback protection builds its own list against the workspace root. No
  effect where the two roots coincide, which is every other configuration.

- **`bmad-loop resolve` advances the re-arm baseline in the code tree, and says so when it cannot**
  (#640). The advance read HEAD of the BMAD project directory rather than the git root, and
  swallowed every failure with a bare `except Exception`, so a re-drive that silently rebuilt
  against the pre-resolution tree looked exactly like one that adopted the human's fix. It is still
  non-fatal outside a repository, but now narrowed to the typed git errors and journalled
  (`rearm-baseline-advance-failed`); anything that is not a git answer propagates.

- **A re-armed story can no longer replay the abandoned attempt's verdict** (#705). Re-arm resets
  `attempt` to 0 and deliberately keeps `task.sessions`, so the next dispatch re-minted a session id
  byte-equal to a record the abandoned attempt had already written — and a host death before the new
  record landed resumed straight into that stale result. A per-task generation counter now
  discriminates the id, emitted only above zero, so every id already on disk stays byte-identical
  and a run resumed across the upgrade still finds its `tasks/` directories.

- **The three review gates run `[verify] commands` in the git root, not the BMAD project
  root** (#695). Under an explicit `repo_root:` with `isolation = "none"` they shelled out in
  the wrong tree — an operator's build/test verbs ran in the BMAD project dir rather than in
  the git root their code lives in.
  Artifact reads — the spec, the sprint board, the deferred-work ledger — stay project-rooted;
  only the command `cwd` moves. Every other caller already used the repo root.
- **A park that produced no code passes the dev gate** (#676). A session parking at
  `awaiting-operator` may legitimately leave nothing but the spec's own park declaration and
  the board sync, both of which proof-of-work excludes — so the gate read a correct park as
  "no changes since baseline commit" and refused it, costing the attempt and the park
  declaration with it. What was still pending at that point was the ORCHESTRATOR's commit —
  the squash and the park record land only once this gate passes; the session's own work is
  usually already committed above baseline, and a reset discards that too (onto an
  `attempt-preserve/*` ref). What the loss looked like depended on configuration — a reverted tree
  under `isolation = "worktree"` or `scm.rollback_on_failure = true`, a paused run with manual
  recovery steps on the default in-place config. Proof-of-work is now skipped on the parked
  leg only; the gate that refuses a park enumerating no `operator_actions` still runs. That skip
  covers every park, including one that produced nothing and listed plausible actions — the
  action gate tests that the list is non-empty, never what is in it.
- **The git-add shield refuses to enable `extensions.worktreeConfig` over an operator's
  explicit disable** (#396), instead of enabling it and deleting the line on rollback. The
  probe read the flag `--type=bool`, so a `false`/`off`/`no`/`0` in the shared config read
  as "needs enabling": the success path rewrote that declaration to `true` permanently, and
  a failed activation's `--unset-all` removed the operator's line and reported a clean
  rollback. Such a repo now gets no shield there, with a reason naming the spelling found.
- **The git-add shield seeds `%APPDATA%/Git/ignore` on Git for Windows >= 2.46** (#403), the
  file that fork prefers over `$HOME/.config/git/ignore` whenever it exists. Seeding the
  `$HOME` one there was wrong in both directions — an empty seed that let global ignores leak
  into `git add -A`, or patterns git is not applying that made session files go missing. Gated
  on the reported version's own `.windows.` fork string, not on the platform.
- **`--run-id` refuses the reserved control-session shape — `ctl` and every `ctl-<anything>`, in
  any letter case**.
  Such an id mints the control session's own name as the run's agent session (`bmad-loop-ctl`,
  or a per-registry `bmad-loop-ctl-<digest>` on psmux), so the adapter adopts the live control
  session and the run's teardown kills it — every parked window with it; on Windows the
  multiplexer resolves session names case-insensitively, so the case variants alias it too. The
  two session namespaces are now disjoint at the mint — and guarded at the read paths for runs
  an older release already persisted under such an id: `resume` and `resolve` refuse (at entry,
  before any side effect) with the recovery steps, while `stop`, `delete`, `archive` and `clean`
  work on the run without ever addressing a session that can be a control session's name (`ctl`,
  `ctl-<16 hex>` — the narrower shape a control session's name can actually take). A historical
  run under any other `ctl-*` id keeps its genuine agent session
  reachable in the registry the process addresses: `stop` kills it there by its exact name, and
  `cleanup` sweeps it like any other run's — including, for a tagged pre-upgrade session left in
  a legacy registry, through the legacy pass (`stop` reaches no registry but the one this
  process exported; the stop itself is registry-independent, only its backstop session kill is
  scoped).
- **TUI: a graceful-stop request that cannot be written is reported, not fatal.** The `S`
  worker caught only the helper's own refusals; an `OSError` from the write itself escaped,
  and Textual's default `exit_on_error` took the dashboard down with it. It now surfaces
  the same "may still be pending" guidance as `stop --graceful`.
- **A denied publish no longer leaks its staging temp on Windows** (#597). The temp had
  already taken a read-only target's READONLY bit when the replace was denied, and Windows
  refuses to delete a READONLY file, so the cleanup was denied too and the temp survived.
  It now clears the bit and retries.
- Refuse a psmux attached-client count whose answer names a different session, so a duplicated
  registry entry can no longer vouch for a `switch-client` that moved nobody — which
  `return_attached_client` reported as `RETURNED`, clearing the return option for a human still
  sitting there. Also refuse an empty or `:`-bearing session name before the probe spawns. A
  same-named session on a foreign server, and one differing only by whitespace the seam
  normalizes away, stay #531's subject (#671)
- The git-add shield's rollback report no longer raises through its own stderr decode on
  Windows (#394). `_shield_undo_extension` is contracted never to raise, but the `fsdecode` of a
  failing `--unset-all`'s stderr was guarded for `GitError` alone.
- **A run ref that names the runs directory itself is refused, and the two destructive run-dir
  writes are contained** (#480). `runs._is_path_escape` was the only member of the seven-site
  guard family omitting `names_tree_root`, so `""` and `"."` joined to the runs root exactly,
  and `delete_run` removed whatever it was handed with a bare `rmtree`. That reach needed a
  `state.json` lying at the runs root — without one those refs fall through to partial matching
  and can only name a child — and the ref is the operator's own argv, so this was a footgun
  rather than an escalation. `delete_run` and `archive_run` now also refuse a `run_dir` that is
  not a direct child of the runs directory, raising `UnconfinedWriteError` ahead of the
  live-session guard and not waived by `--force`. That refusal also covers a `run_dir` spelled
  `runs/..` — the one shape the direct-child rebuild reproduces verbatim while `rmtree` would
  resolve it to `.bmad-loop` itself — and a run-dir level redirected through a symlink or, on
  Windows, an unelevated directory junction, which kept the lexical spelling while sending the
  removal outside the project. An empty run ref is refused outright as well: it is a prefix and
  a suffix of every id, so partial matching read it as a wildcard and resolved the sole run of
  a one-run project.
- **A sweep bundle name that is not a legal path segment is refused at triage** (#637), at both
  of `validate_triage`'s bundle-name sites — the `bundles` list and a decision option's
  `bundle_name`, which becomes `Bundle.name` by way of `_materialize_bundles`. A cycle-1
  bundle's name becomes its directory verbatim, and the reserved device basenames are all
  `[a-z0-9-]`-legal, so `BUNDLE_NAME_RE` accepted `con`, `nul` and `com1` while no Windows
  filesystem would create the directory — matched case-insensitively, so lowercase was no
  reprieve. The test is `safe_segment` identity rather than a second hand-written device list,
  which keeps the accepted set in lockstep with the sanitizer that defines it: the same idiom,
  for the same reason, as `runs.is_valid_run_id`. The persisted pre-answer lane takes the same
  two rules at `_materialize_bundles` — a `bundle_name` answered out of band against an earlier
  triage never passes `validate_triage`, and a fresh triage can renumber the option it named —
  applied by journaled discard rather than by error: the build decision is honored under the
  always-legal `decision-<id>` fallback name.
- **Deferred-work ledger mutators serialize on a cross-process lock** (#286, #469). Every
  mutator was an unlocked read-modify-write of the whole file, so two orchestrator processes —
  a second `bmad-loop run`, a run plus a sweep, a run plus the TUI decision modal, a run plus
  `sweep --archive` — both read, both edited, and the last atomic write won: entries lost,
  closures silently reverted, and two appenders minting the same `DW-<n>` because each read
  `next_seq` from the text it had just read. Every mutator now holds an advisory lock across its
  whole read-modify-write, and the orchestrator's remaining multi-write sequences adopt the
  batched primitives above, so each is one locked pass rather than one open window per row. The
  lock lives at `<state root>/locks/<digest>-<basename>.lock`, out of the repository rather than
  beside the ledger, because the ledger is tracked by design and the engine stages with
  `git add -A`; it is keyed on the resolved path, so every spelling of one file contends on one
  lock. Readers stay lock-free — every writer already replaced the file atomically, so a reader
  sees one whole version or another. Nested acquisition raises instead of self-deadlocking, and a
  lock that cannot be taken fails the write rather than proceeding unlocked. The dev/review
  session's own ledger writes are unchanged and still take no lock. `bmad-loop sweep --archive`
  names the ledger lock in its failure message rather than printing a bare `errno` — as a
  possibility rather than a verdict, since the same arm also catches the archive's own read
  and write failures and a full disk must not send an operator hunting a rival process. And
  `bmad-loop
decisions` and the TUI decision modal now also catch the state-root failure that deriving a
  lock path can raise — in the TUI an uncaught one escaped into the Textual event loop and took
  the dashboard down mid-walk. A project with no ledger at all is still answered without taking a
  lock, so `--archive` keeps reporting it as the success it always was rather than failing
  wherever no state root can be derived. `--archive`'s refusal while a run is live is
  unchanged and deliberately kept: it is coarser than the lock, refusing the archive rewrite outright rather
  than merely serializing it.
- **`sprint-status.yaml` advances serialize on a cross-process lock** (#286, #469). Being the
  board's sole writer was never mutual exclusion — a second orchestrator process runs that same
  sole writer — and an advance is a read-modify-write of the whole board, so two of them both
  read, both edited, and the last atomic write won: a story flipped by one run silently reverted
  to its earlier status, and the run simply walked past it. `advance` now holds the board's own
  sidecar lock across all three of its reads and its write, which also closes the gap inside a
  single call between the never-regress decision and the bytes that decision was applied to. A
  board that does not exist is still reported missing without creating a lock file at all, and a
  lock that cannot be taken fails the advance on the channel that already carries its errors
  rather than rewriting the board unserialized. Recomputing an advance for the isolated-run
  ownership check runs the locked body directly against its private throwaway copy: it needs no
  exclusion, nobody else being able to name that copy, and taking a lock anyway would strand one
  more sidecar keyed on a path that exists only for that call, since lock files are never
  reaped. The atomic, symlink-following,
  read-only-refusing write itself is unchanged.
- **A failed commit now rolls back only the ledger entries the story itself closed** (#286).
  The window between a story's declared `closes_deferred:` closure and its commit spans git
  spawns and, on the escalation leg, a pause for a human, so it is long enough for another
  writer to reach the same ledger — and the rollback used to rewrite the whole document from
  the pre-close text, taking whatever had arrived with it: an entry another process filed
  vanished (and its `DW-<n>` was handed out again), and a closure someone else had verified
  silently reverted to `open`. A story close is therefore written the way a sweep bundle's
  has been since #284, with a durable undo marker owned by that close, and the rollback
  reopens exactly those entries in one locked read-modify-write. Concurrent appends, closes
  and recorded decisions are left standing. An armed entry whose marker has since been
  displaced — a foreign line inserted between the status and its marker breaks the pairing —
  is left `done` with the foreign content intact and journaled as
  `deferred-close-reopen-unmatched`, rather than overwritten around; `deferred-close-rolled-back`
  now names the ids it reopened. The rollback stays advisory: it still never raises out of
  the failure arm it runs inside, so the commit's own escalation remains the disposition.
  **Ledger format:** a story close now leaves a permanent
  `resolution-undo: <digest> <date> <hex>` line beside its `resolution:` line, in the same
  committed ledger — the format `sweep` bundle closes already publish, now used by one more
  writer. Readers that ignore unknown fields are unaffected; `bmad-loop sweep --archive`
  already preserves the line.
- **A rolled-back defer no longer restores its ledger over a writer that arrived during
  the rollback** (#286). The three ledger-restore windows that remain all span `git reset --hard`
  and its preflight spawns, so a lock must not cover them; each is instead compare-and-set
  against the ledger as observed the instant the rollback returned. The defer restore is also
  gated on git owning the file, which inverts the old guard's worst case: on an untracked or
  external ledger — the one kind `reset --hard` cannot have touched — every difference from the
  snapshot was by definition somebody else's write, and rewriting the file on exactly that
  difference is what destroyed it. Such a ledger is now left alone. When the text does move
  between the observation and the lock, the snapshot is republished by APPENDING the entries disk
  has since lost, keyed by DW- id and carrying their bodies verbatim, so a concurrent append
  survives the restore instead of being rolled back with it; `defer-ledger-restore-diverged`
  names the ids moved. Flat appender blocks, which belong to no canonical entry, are reported
  rather than guessed at (`flat_remainder`) — the merge never invents a boundary the parser does
  not model. Entries are matched by id AND body, so an id the reset removed and a rival then
  re-minted for an entry of its own is reported as an `id_collisions` conflict rather than
  silently accepted as already-there: matching on the id alone dropped the very entry the
  merge exists to carry, and re-appending it would publish a duplicate `DW-<n>` instead. A
  write or lock fault still propagates, as the unguarded write always did.
- **A failed legacy-ledger migration refuses to restore over a ledger that changed
  underneath it** (#286). The sweep's post-reset rewrite of the pre-migration text had the
  same unguarded window; on a difference it now journals `sweep-migration-restore-diverged` and
  escalates for a human to re-run the sweep rather than writing. Deliberately no merge and
  no silent skip: leaving the rejected rewrite standing is the "never re-prompt over a
  half-broken rewrite" failure the restore exists to prevent, and a migration input that
  moved after the attempt was graded against it is a human problem — the same call the
  duplicate-id refusal already makes.
- **A rejected attempt's ledger retraction no longer overwrites, or deletes, a concurrent
  writer's work** (#286). This restore compares against two anchors — a persisted digest of the
  bytes the engine itself last published, and the ledger as observed the instant the rollback
  returned when git owns the file and its `reset --hard` republished it. Matching neither means
  the text is somebody else's, and the restore degrades to a journaled
  `ledger-restore-skipped-diverged` skip rather than a write. Deliberately no merge: a
  retraction cannot be expressed as an append. The skip is the safe direction — the
  harvest entries left standing are real findings, `append_entry`'s idempotence stops the
  next attempt filing them twice, and a non-restored ledger already reads as "changed" to
  the attribution rebase, which stands the harvest exclusion down and exposes more of the
  tree to the proof-of-work gate. The `snapshot is None` arm, which retracts a ledger the
  harvest itself created, is gated on the same digest, closing a latent data loss: it
  previously deleted whatever it found at that path, so a ledger a concurrent writer had
  created inside the window went with it. A tracked ledger absent at snapshot time is
  still never deleted, and is now answered before any lock is taken. A write or lock fault
  is journaled as `ledger-restore-failed` and preserves an in-flight pause, as before.
- **A read-dependent no-op is answered before its lock is taken** (#736). Taking a lock for
  work that turns out to write nothing could fail a call that used to succeed — a replayed
  `bmad-loop confirm` against a story the board already records as `done`, a replayed
  rollback, `sweep --archive` over a ledger holding nothing closed — either on contention or
  on deriving a sidecar path where no state root exists. `sprintstatus.advance` and the five
  read-dependent `deferred-work.md` mutators now take one advisory read first, running the
  same pure decision helper the locked pass runs; only a writes-nothing answer skips the lock,
  and every other answer, plus any probe fault, falls through to the hold and decides there.
  `sweep --archive` with nothing eligible now exits 0 rather than 1; an eligible archive under
  a dead lock still fails as before. `append_entries_published` deliberately still locks on a
  missing ledger, where absence means create.
- **A ledger restore that spans `git reset --hard` anchors on the committed baseline blob**
  (#735). The three restores no lock may cover — the rejected attempt's retraction, a rolled
  back defer's, and the sweep's failed-migration rewrite — compared the ledger against an
  observation read after the reset returned. A rival writing a tracked ledger inside that
  window became the observation, so the compare held and the restore overwrote its entries.
  Each write arm now takes its expected text from the ledger's blob at the baseline commit,
  probed before the lock, since a lock may never span a subprocess. Where the reset
  republishes no text at all — an untracked ledger, one configured outside the repo tree, or
  one symlinked into it, whose blob is a target pathname rather than ledger text — the anchor
  is the rewrite the attempt actually graded. Where no anchor can be derived, the retraction
  skips, the defer restore merges what disk has lost, and the sweep escalates; those
  doubly-uncertain cases previously still wrote. A rival whose text is byte-equal to the
  anchor stays indistinguishable from the reset's own work.

### Security

- **`bmad-loop diagnose` no longer ships a merge record's target branch verbatim** (#640).
  The journal's `target` field carries a branch on `unit-merge-started`, `unit-merged` and
  `resume-unit-merge` but a sprint status on the `board-advance-*` family, and per-field
  routing is by field NAME — so the field was left unrouted and an identifier-shaped branch
  name (`main`, `release`) passed through `scrub_json` into a bundle meant to be posted
  publicly. The egress backstop only masked it: it repairs a value already in the legend, so
  a run that journalled the same branch earlier was rescued while disclosing a
  `backstop_repairs` gap, and a journal truncated past that event was not rescued at all.
  Routing gains a narrow kind-scoped table for this one overloaded field; the sprint status
  keeps rendering verbatim, since aliasing it would destroy what those records are read for.
  The producers are deliberately NOT renamed —
  `engine._replay_unlatched_ledger_carries` correlates the merge kinds on a tuple including
  that field and reads journals written by earlier processes, so a rename would break the
  carry replay across a version boundary.

- **The run-archive staging temp is minted by `mkstemp` beside the destination — exclusive,
  `0600`, freshly named per attempt** (#591). The fixed temp name was created and unlinked by
  name, so a symlink planted there was followed and the cleanup could remove a concurrent
  archiver's in-flight temp; the exclusive create closes both, and the unpredictable
  per-attempt name keeps a temp stranded by a kill — or a file planted at a guessable name —
  from denying every later archive. The staged tarball is also `fsync`ed before publish,
  since the run dir it came from is removed immediately after.
- **Confined atomic writers anchor a file's parent with a directory descriptor instead of
  resolving it by name** (#593). `follow_symlinks=False` refuses a link planted at the file
  itself, but every directory above it was still looked up by name, so a link planted at
  `.bmad-loop/` redirected the staging and the publish both. `atomic_write_text_confined` and
  `atomic_write_bytes_confined` walk the components `O_NOFOLLOW` and write through the
  resulting descriptor; a refusal raises `UnconfinedWriteError`, an `OSError`. Windows has no
  `*at()` family and degrades to the documented check-then-write.
- **The orchestrator's own writers under session-writable roots adopted those confined
  helpers** (#593): the decisions store, park records, the stop-request channel (the graceful
  lodge keeps its exclusive-create arbitration, now anchored at the walked parent), sweep
  decisions, `policy.toml`, the story-spec writers, and the run's config-digest stamp. A
  story spec in an artifacts folder configured _outside_ the checkout keeps the plain
  no-follow write — supported configuration a confined write cannot vouch for.

## [0.11.1] — 2026-08-23

### Added

- **git 2.34 or newer is now a declared prerequisite**, and the first one the orchestrator
  enforces. Set to keep Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (stock git 2.34) supported; Ubuntu 20.04 (2.25) and
  Debian 11 (2.30) fall below it. This is a support floor, not a capability one — nothing
  bmad-loop runs needs 2.34 — so the project can stop carrying workarounds for untested git.
  - `bmad-loop validate` checks it, as `git.version`.
  - `bmad-loop diagnose` records the host's git version in its Environment block.

### Changed

- **`run`, `sweep` and `resume` refuse to start below git 2.34, and `validate` now exits 1
  there** — a change of exit code on an under-floor host. A git that cannot be run, times out,
  or answers unparseably is refused the same way. `--dry-run` names the refusal in its
  "NOT runnable" banner instead of previewing a run that cannot start, and the TUI's
  pre-launch guard toasts it instead of opening a pane that dies.
- **The git-add shield's version gate moves from 2.20 to the project floor.** It now refuses as
  an unsupported-version policy rather than claiming a missing capability, which would be false
  at 2.34 — git 2.25 has everything the shield uses.
- **The git-add shield's activation check has git name the winning scope (#692).** The shield
  already refused to trust a `core.excludesFile` write it could not confirm git reads; the
  degrade reason now says _which_ configuration scope won, from the same single probe
  (`git config --show-scope`, git 2.26 — inside the 2.34 floor, which is what unblocked it):
  an ambient command-scope override (`git -c`, `GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS`, `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT`)
  now reads differently from a worktree write git does not see at all, which is a different
  repair. An rc-0 answer that names no scope is a new fail-closed degrade rather than a
  mismatch mislabelled. The decision is unchanged — a byte-identical answer still activates
  whatever scope supplied it, every unconfirmed answer still degrades, and the repo-format
  flag is still rolled back.
- **A hard stop rides `stop-request.json` with `mode: "hard"` (#319).** It is lodged before the
  engine is signalled — the atomic write also supersedes a pending graceful request — and honored
  at item boundaries and mid-session, where both real adapter wait loops poll it twice per iteration,
  which normally lands well inside the 10s grace window. An iteration blocked on a transport call
  or waiting for an artifact can exceed it, and the stop then degrades to the force-kill backstop —
  the pre-#319 outcome, never a worse one. SIGTERM is now the POSIX fast path rather than the mechanism, so a hard stop
  lands on every platform and multiplexer backend, and reaches a nested auto-sweep through the
  owning run's channel — hard-only; `stop <child-id>` is unchanged. A run directory that rejects
  the write degrades to the signal path with the stop still delivered.
- **`status --json`'s `graceful_stop_pending` is now mode-exact (#319)** — it reports only
  genuinely graceful requests. A modeless pre-#319 request body still reads graceful.
- **`stop --graceful` and the TUI report an already-pending request without calling it graceful
  (#319).** The request standing on disk may be a hard one — `stop` leaves one lodged when it
  could not prove the engine dead — and the idempotency answer is deliberately mode-blind.

### Removed

- **`verify.same_commit` is gone — nothing called it.** #645's `_canonical_commit_oid` displaced
  its last call site and compares canonical full object ids exactly. The helper's leftover
  prefix-tolerant equality — either argument a prefix of the other once both reach 7 characters —
  would have handed that looseness to whichever caller reached for it next.

### Fixed

- Escape gitignore pattern syntax (wildmatch specials, trailing spaces) when rendering
  worktree shield patterns, so a seed path carrying such syntax is shielded and its broken
  pattern can no longer hide an unrelated file (#476)
- Tokenize settled exclude lines the way git does (`\n`-split, one trailing `\r` trimmed), so
  an operator line carrying a lone `\r` can no longer make the shield writer skip a needed
  pattern (#472)
- Stop shielding a tracked tool directory whole: its pattern is replaced by per-file patterns
  for the untracked files provisioning wrote, so its tracked children no longer read as ignored
  to repo-hygiene gates. A file the session itself creates under such a directory can now be
  staged; an untracked tool directory keeps its ambient pattern unchanged (#484)
- **A queued release publish can no longer be evicted by a newer push (#468)** — the
  repo-wide `release-publish` concurrency group now sets `queue: max`; the default
  single-slot queue cancels an older _pending_ run when a newer one queues, so a
  maintenance-branch publish could be silently discarded by an unrelated `main` push.
  Also pins `cmd_publish`'s `check=False` with a regression test (the lost-race swallow
  was one revert away from dead code with the suite still green) and corrects a comment
  that still described the group as keying on `github.ref`.
- TUI: story-gate and epic-boundary pauses open a pause-reason viewer naming the blocking
  entries and the remedy, instead of an empty spec pane (#515)
- **Provisioning refuses an unparseable seeded hook config instead of silently replacing it
  (#592).** An isolated worktree's seeded `.claude/settings.json` that failed to parse was read
  as an empty document, so the relay merge always ran against a blank baseline and published a
  hooks-only file — the operator's permission allowlist, `env` and MCP entries gone, with no
  message and no backup. #590 made that write atomic; the parse still substituted `{}`, and
  that swallow is what this closes. Provisioning now raises, escalating the story as CRITICAL
  and pausing the run with the bytes untouched — the policy `init` has always applied to an
  unparseable config. The refusal names whichever source actually supplied the bytes — read from
  the seed bookkeeping, which now records each path copied rather than each entry attempted, so a
  config carried in as a child of a seeded directory is told apart from one merely sitting beside
  a seeded sibling. Invalid UTF-8 joins the same lane, having previously crashed the engine
  rather than escalating.
- **Native Windows: `bmad-loop stop` no longer burns the full 10s grace window into a blind
  `taskkill /F` (#319).** An inter-process SIGTERM is never delivered to a native-Windows engine,
  so every stop completed through the external fallback with no engine teardown at all. The engine
  honors the stop request itself now, so it is the single writer of `stopped` again and
  `run-stop fallback=True` is no longer stamped on a stop the engine recorded itself — it marks
  one this tool had to complete from outside.
- **`bmad-loop stop` no longer reports success when it delivered neither channel (#319).** A run
  directory that rejects the request write, followed by a signal the OS refuses, left the CLI
  saying the run had stopped — and stamping `run-stop fallback=True` — over an engine that may
  still be running with nothing on disk to stop it. It now kills the agent session as a backstop,
  records the undelivered attempt, and exits non-zero naming the retry.
- **Two concurrent `stop` invocations against one run no longer collide on a staging temp (#319).**
  The write staged through a fixed `stop-request.json.tmp`, so the loser's rename raised
  `FileNotFoundError`. It now stages under a per-writer name: the last write wins and neither
  caller errors.
- **`resume` no longer re-arms a run whose stale stop request it could not remove (#319).** It read
  "could not remove it" as "nothing was pending", wrote the pid, and stopped again at the first
  item boundary with nothing printed to say why. Resume now refuses before the pid lands and names
  the file, without re-stamping the host-exec integrity pin for a run it never started.
  `stop --cancel-graceful` likewise stops reporting "no stop request pending" for a request still
  on disk and still honorable — same exit code, accurate message.
- **A `stop` that never proved the engine dead keeps its request lodged (#319).** A `terminate` or
  `force_kill` refused with `PermissionError`, or a `taskkill /F /T` that failed silently,
  discarded the hard request while reporting the run stopped — throwing away the only channel left
  to stop a live engine. Death is now distinguished from refusal, so the stop stays genuinely in
  flight.
- **A hard stop arriving as the last item finishes stops the run instead of reporting it completed
  (#319).** Covers `max-stories-reached` too; a graceful request at an exhausted queue still
  finishes truthfully.
- **`stop --graceful` no longer downgrades a hard request that landed while it ran (#319).** The
  graceful lodge is now an atomic `O_CREAT | O_EXCL` create that answers "already pending" for
  anything already there, and a symlink planted at the path is refused rather than followed. Two
  concurrent graceful asks resolve the same way, which is the documented idempotency. A write that
  fails part-way leaves the request standing instead of rolling back — an unlink there resolves the
  path, not the file the call created, so it could remove a hard request escalated onto it — and
  `stop --graceful` reports it as possibly pending rather than as a clean failure.
- **A policy field of the wrong TOML type now raises `PolicyError` naming `section.key`
  (#440).** `loads()` coerced with bare `int()`/`float()`/`bool()`/`str()` outside the
  `PolicyError` funnel, so a wrong-typed value escaped every handler written to degrade on
  one: `_configure_mux` runs before dispatch on _every_ command, so one bad character in
  `.bmad-loop/policy.toml` traced back at you; the TUI died at construction instead of
  falling back to defaults; and `validate --json` exited before printing the document its
  one-object contract promises, which now carries the fault as an ordinary `policy` finding.
  Two of these never announced themselves at all: `notify.desktop = "false"` is a truthy
  string, so it turned the feature **on** (the hazard #278 recorded), and
  `verify.commands = "pytest"` exploded into six one-character commands that read back as
  applied configuration. Extends #587's `[limits]` sweep to every remaining section, with
  `[limits]`' own messages unchanged; allowlisted fields blame the type first. Valid policies
  parse identically — an unset `extra_args` still means "inherit the profile's flags" where
  `[]` means "none".
- **An undecodable or unreadable profile overlay or plugin manifest is a typed error naming
  the file, not a traceback (#473, #689).** `load_profiles` and the plugin loader read each
  `*.toml` outside the funnel that converts parse faults, so a non-UTF-8 file escaped as a
  raw `UnicodeDecodeError` past consumers that all key on the domain error: `validate --json`
  printed a bare `error:` line and empty stdout instead of an `adapter.profile` finding,
  `get_profile` carried it into run/sweep preflight, and a bad project `plugin.toml` took the
  settings screen down at construction. Both loaders now raise `ProfileError`/`PluginError`
  naming the path, on both arms — a file present but unreadable (permissions, a dead mount)
  was leaking a bare `OSError` on the same route. The packaged built-ins read through the
  same guard: a corrupt install is a packaging bug and should say so.
- **Merge-back failures are classified from the measured tree state, and the catch-all stopped
  inventing a conflict (#619).** A merge that died part-way through its checkout — all three
  strategies, `--ff-only` included — now raises `MergeHalfAppliedError` instead of "refused
  before starting": untracked residue is named for you to clear, and a tracked rewrite is
  restored automatically by `git checkout HEAD --` over exactly the affected paths.
  Attribution is per path — before/after deltas intersected with the branch's incoming set —
  so neither your pre-existing dirt nor an edit you make outside that incoming set while the
  merge is failing is ever called git's: the repo-wide dirtiness reading this replaces
  classified that concurrent-edit scene "failed part-way through checkout" and its repo-wide
  `reset --hard HEAD` destroyed the edit. (An edit racing the very paths the merge is
  rewriting is indistinguishable from git's write and is restored with them — the stated
  ceiling.) A post-merge probe that itself fails — the
  residue probes, the unmerged-stages reading, or the MERGE_HEAD reading — no longer bypasses the
  merge cleanup or impersonates a verdict: cleanup not gated on the dead reading still runs, the
  failure raises `MergeResidueUnreadError` (checkout state unverified, run `git status`), and an
  unread MERGE_HEAD skips the abort it gates and says so. The squash **replay** reading gets the
  same honesty on the far side of success: unreadable, it used to answer "dirty", and the doomed
  `git commit` that followed dressed the probe failure as a commit refusal with a
  `reset --hard HEAD` riding on it — now nothing is committed, nothing is reset, and the
  escalation names the dead reading. A refused
  **squash commit** now raises `MergeCommitRefusedError` like the `--no-ff` leg — the squash leg
  seals its result with its own `git commit`, where commit hooks and signing do run — rolled back
  by `git reset --hard HEAD` gated on the pre-merge reading having found the tree clean (a dirty
  checkout is never reset; the
  escalation then names the staged result and clearing it as your first step). A content conflict
  is typed too (`MergeConflictError`), so anything unclassified escalates saying just that — run
  `git status`, git's text names the cause — instead of "resolve the conflict by hand".
- **psmux: a hand-back that succeeded no longer reports as failed — or undoes itself (#659).**
  `switch_client` read its verdict off the session's attached-client count, which a same-session
  move cannot change — and same-session is the common shape for the return path, so a correct
  hand-back answered "failed". With the last-client fallback enabled (how
  `return_attached_client` always calls it) that verdict then fired `switch-client -l`, relocating
  the operator to an unrelated session; the relocation supplied the count change the correct move
  could not, so the call reported success and cleared its return option. The `-t` verb now takes
  its exit code as the verdict, gated on a client having been attached, and the fallback fires
  only when that verb failed.
- **A sweep whose client has dropped no longer keeps prompting the empty window (#659).** On tmux,
  `switch-client` spends one nonzero exit on both "that target is unreachable" and "there is no
  client here at all", so a failed hand-back read as "the human is still in front of me" either
  way; the session's attached-client count now separates them. `TerminalMultiplexer.switch_client`
  answers a third value, `None`, for any move it cannot vouch for — that state, a timed-out verb,
  and on psmux an unreadable gate count — which `return_attached_client` routes to `UNREACHABLE`:
  the return option survives, but the sweep goes unattended instead of blocking a later `--repeat`
  cycle on `input()`. `False` now carries the joint claim its caller always read it as. Out-of-tree
  backends answering a plain bool still work; `detach_client` is unchanged.
- **A psmux probe now answers for the calling pane, not the focused window (#669).** A target-less
  `display-message -p` resolves the server's _active_ window, so `current_window_id`,
  `current_pane_id`, `current_session` and `current_return_target` answered for a foreign window
  whenever the caller's own window was not the focused one — the ctl prune could kill the window it
  was running in, and the attach return could record a pane the human never came from. The probes
  now pin to the calling pane via `TMUX_PANE`, and answer `None` without spawning when that value
  is absent or not pane-shaped.
- **An unresolvable restore-patch or spec-folder path is now a named refusal, not a bare
  `[Errno ...]` (#560).** `_resolve_restore_patch` (`cli --restore-patch`) and
  `relativize_spec_folder` (`--spec`, `[stories] source`) each called `.resolve()` outside the
  exception type their handler caught, so a host that cannot canonicalize the path — a dead UNC
  provider (`WinError 64`), a symlink loop on the 3.11/3.12 floor — escaped by a route neither
  describes. Both now refuse by name and point at `bmad-loop validate`: the restore patch returns
  its sibling rejected-latch shape, the spec folder raises `stories.StoriesError`, and `--dry-run`
  reports it before exiting 1. A spec folder that merely lies outside the project tree still comes
  back verbatim — that is a supported layout, and only the canonicalization leg refuses.
- **An unstaged edit in your main checkout no longer escalates the story and pauses an unattended
  run (#618).** Under `[scm] isolation = "worktree"` the merge pre-flight refused over any dirty
  _tracked_ path outside the unit branch's incoming set, so a worktree-only porcelain `M` — modified in the
  working tree, nothing staged — stopped the run over a hazard git itself does not have. The axis
  is the index column, not trackedness: such a stray is now tolerated and journaled
  `merge-target-tolerated` alongside untracked dirt. A **staged** stray still escalates.
- **Dirt on a path the run commits for itself now blocks the merge whatever its index column
  (#618).** The post-merge carries stage the sprint board and the deferred-work ledger by
  pathspec, which takes whatever the working tree holds no matter who wrote it, so narrowing the
  pre-flight to staged strays alone would have let an operator's private edit land in history
  under a `chore(sprint-status): carry ...` message with the tree left clean. Both paths are now
  passed to the pre-flight as protected, and a stray among them escalates with its own remedy —
  such dirt has to leave the path, not merely be unstaged. Tracked artifacts only.
- **A resumed run no longer commits — or overwrites — board edits you made while it was down
  (#618).** When the merge was already journaled `unit-merged`, the replay falls through to the
  carry commits with no pre-flight in front of them. The carry cannot simply refuse on dirt: a
  crashed pass's own half-written advance is dirt on exactly that path and finishing it is what
  the leg exists for. It now asks whether the board holds HEAD's content plus this pass's
  advance — git's own question, so a board spelled CRLF by one host and LF by another still
  answers yes — and proves the index too, since the carry's `git add` overwrites it as well as
  the working tree; an ABSENT index entry counts as a staged untracking (`git rm --cached`) rather
  than as nothing to lose. That guards the commit, which is one write too late for the OWN row:
  `advance` would already have replaced the edit with the target, leaving precisely the bytes the
  proof accepts. So that row is now checked BEFORE the advance, and a status that is neither
  HEAD's nor this pass's own refuses it. Either refusal journals `board-advance-carry-foreign-dirt`.
- **A merge git refused before it started no longer sends you to resolve a conflict that does not
  exist (#619).** Every `GitError` out of the merge was labelled "content conflict against the
  target", but most are git declining at pre-flight — an untracked file the merge would overwrite,
  a staged change on an incoming path, a file/directory shape clash, an `ff` target that cannot
  fast-forward — where nothing merged, the target checkout is untouched, and there are no markers
  to find. Those now raise `verify.MergePreflightError` (a `GitError` subclass, so every existing
  handler is unchanged) and escalate describing that state, with git's own text naming the cause.
  A third state needed its own type. A `--no-ff` that merges cleanly and is then refused at the
  COMMIT — a `pre-merge-commit` or `commit-msg` hook, or a `commit.gpgsign` that cannot sign —
  leaves no unmerged stages but does leave `MERGE_HEAD`, so reading the index alone called a
  started merge a pre-flight refusal and sent you to clear a clash that does not exist.
  `verify.MergeCommitRefusedError` now names it: the merge is aborted and the escalation points at
  the policy that declined rather than at a tree with nothing wrong. Where the abort ITSELF fails,
  it says so and sends you to recover the mid-merge checkout first — a resume attempted before
  that dies on the merge state however well the hook is fixed.
- **A refused `squash` merge no longer destroys the uncommitted work in your main checkout
  (#619).** `--squash` has no `--abort`, so the recovery is `git reset --hard HEAD` — gated on a
  tree-state probe read _after_ the merge and used to answer "did the squash act". A checkout
  already carrying an unstaged edit reads dirty whether or not git touched a byte, so a merge git
  refused at pre-flight fired the reset and discarded work the merge never went near. The probe is
  now read once _before_ the squash and a tree found dirty is never reset. The same root cause
  corrupted the replay gate that recognises "the squash staged nothing", which now asks the index.
- **The journal no longer records a path as tolerated when that path is what stopped the merge
  (#623).** `merge-target-tolerated` is written from inside the pre-flight guard, strictly before
  the merge runs, so it can only record what the guard decided. A stray outside the incoming set
  by _path_ can still clash with it by _shape_ — a file where the merge needs a directory, or the
  reverse — and git then refuses over the very path the event called harmless. The refusal path
  now appends a corrective `merge-preflight-refused` naming the same paths and carrying git's text.
- `bmad-loop ls` on a core-only install lists runs again instead of crashing on a missing `pyte`
  — the run-inventory reader moved into core (#650)
- A missing `[tui]` extra now prints the install hint whichever dependency fails first, instead of
  a traceback (#678)
- The settings schema no longer reaches the `[tui]` extra at module scope, and CI now proves the
  core CLI works extra-less (#679)

## [0.11.0] — 2026-08-19

### Added

- **Plugins can now observe structured dev verification results (#641).** The existing
  `post_dev_verify` hook receives immutable per-command results after normal and repair
  verification, with separate `stdout`/`stderr` alongside the compatible bounded
  `output_tail`. The context also carries `verification_stage` (`"dev"` or `"fix"`) and
  `verification_sequence` — the only way to tell a dev verification from a repair one
  (both emit the same stage from the same phase) and the key that joins the context to
  its own journal records. Core writes `verify-command-result` journal records with
  stream pointers under the run's `verify/` directory — its own store, kept out of the
  adapter-owned, TUI-consumed `logs/`; plugins remain unable to alter verification or
  commit decisions. Storage, upload, signing, and any policy response stay plugin-owned.
  Scope is the dev phase: the review gate runs the same `[verify] commands` and retains
  nothing, so the journal records are not a census of a run's verifier invocations —
  `docs/plugin-authoring-guide.md` states the boundary, and #656 tracks closing it.
  Retention is bounded by the new `[verify] stream_capture_kb` (default 256 KiB per
  stream, `0` = capture nothing): the tail is kept, and the record carries the full
  byte count plus a `*_truncated` flag so a cut file is never mistaken for a whole
  one. A concluded run gives the store back: `bmad-loop clean` trims `verify/` with the
  rest of a run's heavy scaffolding and counts it in the reclaimed total, leaving the
  run listed and resumable. Separately from that on-disk cap, a hard 32 MiB per-stream
  ceiling bounds what is held in memory while the remaining commands run, so a
  pathologically chatty suite cannot grow peak memory with the number of configured
  verify commands; the record still reports what the command emitted, so a stream the
  ceiling cut is never mistaken for a whole one. Retaining a stream is observation, so a
  failed write (ENOSPC, a read-only run dir) degrades — the record still lands, with a
  null pointer and `capture_error` — instead of taking down a dev pass whose verify
  commands passed.

- **A refused auto-sweep is now visible outside the journal (#501).** A run whose deferred-work
  sweep was refused ended looking exactly like one that swept, and under `[sweep] auto = "run-end"`
  there is one trigger per run that is never re-asked once the run finishes — so the journal was
  the only trace. Runs now record `sweeps_refused` (trigger → reason), surfaced by the end-of-run
  summary, `bmad-loop status`, `status --json` and `bmad-loop diagnose`; the follow-up they name
  is `bmad-loop sweep`, which needs a clean worktree. The reason is a fixed slug — `not-started`,
  `failed` or `dirty` — never an exception message, which `diagnose` would refuse to emit at all.
  The `--json` key is additive and always present, so `STATUS_SCHEMA_VERSION` is unchanged.

- **`validate` now reports a binary that is on PATH but will not run (#294).** The
  `adapter.binary` gate asked `shutil.which`, which a dead WSL/npm shim satisfies — it is a real
  file with the execute bit — so validate went green on an install that could not start a session,
  and the opencode adapter's own "binary not found" error sent the user to `bmad-loop validate` to
  be told everything was fine. Each binary named by a **packaged** profile is now run once as
  `<binary> --version`; a nonzero exit or a launch fault reports the new check id
  `adapter.binary-unrunnable`, carrying the resolved path and the return code. A project overlay's
  profile is resolved and reported found but never launched: its fields are project-supplied, and
  validate is the command used to decide whether a checkout is safe to run at all, so a clone's own
  config cannot choose which binary it launches. The gate bounds which NAME is probed, not what
  that name resolves to — resolution runs through the user's `PATH`, and a probed name resolves to
  whatever the session launch would itself run. That boundary is the profile's provenance and not
  the spelling of `binary`, because a bare name still resolves into the checkout whenever a
  checkout-local directory is on `PATH`. The severity is `warning`, so validate's exit code is
  unchanged for a live CLI that merely answers `--version` oddly, and `adapter.binary` keeps its
  existing found/absent meaning. The check id is additive, so `VALIDATE_SCHEMA_VERSION` is
  unchanged.

### Changed

- **The psmux live gate now runs in CI instead of before releases (#662).** The `test-windows`
  job installs psmux from its GitHub release, so `tests/test_psmux_live.py` — prune isolation, the
  workaround premise probes, the 3.3.8-floor adoption probes — runs on every pull request
  and on pushes to `main`/`release/*`, rather than on a maintainer's Windows box at release
  time. It runs as its own serial step: real psmux servers are a single-machine resource,
  and the gate flaked when interleaved with the parallel run. The step asserts
  `PsmuxMultiplexer.available()`, not just that the binary resolves: the gate skips itself on
  an unadmitted version, which would otherwise read green. `test_opencode_live.py` remains the
  one manual gate.

- **The psmux backend now requires psmux 3.3.8 or newer (#658, closes #222).** `available()`
  refuses 3.3.7 and below, so **on such a host the backend reports unavailable and selection
  falls through**. Every verb now assumes 3.3.8's fixes instead of routing around the defects
  they close, and a 3.3.7 install would fail silently rather than loudly.

- **The retired psmux workarounds change three visible behaviors (#658).** The run-log sink rides
  the same `-EncodedCommand` transport as every other window command instead of a sidecar
  `.ps1`, so a log path containing a space, `$` or a backtick no longer breaks or blocks log
  capture, and nothing is written beside the log. `select-window` takes the session-qualified window id
  directly, dropping a listing round-trip per focus change. `kill_session` inherits the base's
  `=name` exact-match target.

- **The psmux option-value gate now refuses only what it cannot read back (#658).** Ordinary
  Windows paths all pass — spaced, UNC, apostrophed, trailing-separator. What stays refused is
  what the backend's own listing parse would mangle: a double quote, a line break, edge
  whitespace, and a `-`-leading value psmux still treats as a flag.

- **`post_dev_verify` now fires on the repair leg too, not only after dev verification (#641).**
  A plugin written against "once per story, after the dev session" will see the stage again after
  every repair session's verification, and on the way to a pause: an attempt whose session reported
  a CRITICAL escalation now emits before the run stops, on either leg, where the repair leg used to
  escalate without emitting at all. Discriminate the legs with `ctx.verification_stage`
  (`"dev"` / `"fix"`) and de-duplicate on `ctx.verification_sequence`; handlers that assumed one
  call per story must be idempotent.

- **`probe-adapter` now bounds how long a single scrubbed line can be (#481).** `scrub_text` capped
  how many lines it emitted but never how long one of them could be, so a single very long line —
  from a foreign CLI's `--version`/`--help`, or from a log tail — reached the `probe-adapter`
  report and its `--json` document verbatim: `max_lines=5` over a 5000-character line still emitted
  all 5000. Each line is now bounded, and a line that is cut ends with `… (N more chars redacted)`,
  the same convention as the existing line-count marker. **This is a visible output change** for any
  line that long. A cut that would land inside anything the egress guard flags — a credential-shaped
  token, or a URL credential whose match ends at the `@` — retracts out of it and drops it whole:
  cutting mid-construct could otherwise leave a fragment that keeps the sensitive part while no
  longer tripping the rule, turning a fail-closed refusal into an emission carrying part of the
  credential. `probe.SCHEMA_VERSION` is unchanged: no field is removed or renamed and no type
  changes, and the meaning of the value was already "the CLI's scrubbed output, capped" — adding a
  second axis to an already-documented lossy cap is the same class of value, not a new one.

- **Files the orchestrator replaces by name now land at `0600`.** Those writes pass
  `follow_symlinks=False`, and that mode deliberately carries nothing over from the target — not
  its permission bits, not its xattrs — so the new contents arrive at `mkstemp`'s private default.
  Affected: `.bmad-loop/decisions.json`, `.bmad-loop/policy.toml`, the park records under
  `.bmad-loop/operator/`, and any story spec written through `set_frontmatter_status`,
  `set_frontmatter_field` or `devcontract`. Most were already being reset to `0644` on every
  rewrite — the hand-rolled temp they replaced was created at `0666 & ~umask` and `os.replace`
  swapped _that_ inode into place — so for those the delta is `0644` → `0600`. Git records no mode
  but the exec bit, so nothing downstream of a commit notices.

  The no-follow choice is made per **file**, not per call site: once one writer of a file replaces
  it by name, every writer of that file has to, or they disagree about what the path means.
  Applying it that way brought four writers into line that had been direct
  `write_text`/`write_bytes` calls — `verify.safe_rollback`, the engine's park-record restore,
  `set_frontmatter_status` and `set_frontmatter_field`. Those four opened the name, and so wrote
  _through_ any symlink planted at it; they now replace it. That is a real change at those four,
  and what makes it safe is the same per-file rule: each of those files already had a
  name-replacing sibling writer (`policy.write_mux_backend`, `record_park`,
  `devcontract._atomic_write_spec`), so no link at those names survived the orchestrator anyway.
  Files with no name-replacing sibling keep following symlinks — `sprint-status.yaml` and your
  CLI's `settings.json`, both operator-curated, so a board or a config kept outside the tree and
  linked in keeps being a link.

- **`atomic_write_bytes` accepts `follow_symlinks`, as its text sibling already did.** The default
  stays `True`, which the private-git-exclude writer depends on: it pre-creates the target
  precisely so the helper has a umask mode to carry over, and git silently ignores an exclude file
  it cannot read.

### Fixed

- **A failed `kill-window` that left the window alive is no longer swallowed (#658).**
  `BaseTmuxBackend.kill_window` ran `check=False` and discarded the result, so a kill that failed
  with the window still standing left it behind with no trace. A non-zero exit now reads the
  session's own window list once and warns on stderr only when the target's window is still in
  it; an already-gone window — what ordinary teardown produces — and a target that names no
  window at all both stay silent, because neither leaves anything behind. The verdict is
  unchanged: still returns `None`, still never raises.

- **A plugin can no longer erase a CRITICAL escalation out from under the engine's audit.**
  `HookContext` copies the session `result_json` precisely so a plugin observes history rather
  than rewriting it, but `dict()` is shallow: the nested `escalations` list stayed the engine's
  own object, and both verify legs emit `post_dev_verify` before reading
  `critical_escalations(result.result_json)`. An in-process plugin that cleared that list
  therefore erased the escalation before the audit ran, and a verify-green repair proceeded
  where the run owed a pause. The copy is now deep, so the observe-only guarantee holds at the
  depth escalations actually live.

- **The egress self-check now sees Windows→WSL UNC home paths (#512).** `diagnose` and
  `probe-adapter` re-scan their own rendered bytes before emitting and refuse to emit at all on a
  hit, but the absolute-home-path rule knew only forward-slash spellings — so a path reached through
  the Windows→WSL UNC bridge (`\\wsl.localhost\<distro>\home\<user>`, the legacy `\\wsl$\...`, the
  extended-length `\\?\UNC\...` folding) was invisible to it, including through the `--json` render,
  where every backslash is doubled. **No released version leaked such a path**: since #485
  `collect_env` reduces the project path to a boolean and no `EnvInfo` field carries it. What was
  wrong was the claim — the `diagnostics` module docstring described the backstop as fail-closed
  without qualification — and that docstring is corrected in the same change to say what the guard
  is, a shape re-scan of the rendered bytes, and what stays outside it: a home spelling it does not
  know, or a username that is not this process's.

- **The `diagnose` policy snapshot's verbatim-key invariant is now enforced (#202).** The snapshot
  emits dict keys unredacted, which is correct only while no policy section is a free-keyed table
  — the one user-keyed table, `plugins.settings`, is intercepted before it reaches the
  passthrough. Nothing enforced that property, and a value-level check could not: a newly declared
  free-keyed section defaults to an empty dict, so such a check stays green while the hazard is
  live. A test now fails at declaration time, the moment such a section appears, and the reason is
  written down at the passthrough. No behavior change.

- **The zero-token OpenCode live smoke skips stale or broken shims (#294).** Its availability
  gate now requires `opencode --version` to succeed before starting a server; runnable installs
  still fail loudly when the pinned API contract drifts.

- **Policy loading now enforces the declared timeout and result-less Stop nudge minima (#648).**
  The valid `session_timeout_min = 1` and `stop_without_result_nudges = 0` boundaries remain
  accepted, while smaller values now raise `PolicyError`.

- **Reject mismatched TOML scalar types for every `limits.*` policy field (#278).**
  Quoted booleans and other coercible values now raise `PolicyError` instead of silently changing
  the configured limit or enabling a disabled behavior.

- **Attempt-owned spec-only retries no longer demand a false manual rollback (#123).** A
  bound plain attempt whose only residue is its lifecycle flip is restored to its pre-attempt
  lifecycle status and proven Git-clean before retry. A resolved re-drive may instead retain an
  authorized dirty, human-corrected spec and reports `rollback-owned-spec-normalized` without
  claiming cleanliness or auto-committing the correction. Each bound retry chain now snapshots its
  first spec input byte-for-byte and retains it across dev- and review-verification repairs, so a
  later failed child cannot replace that input with its own body edits. Non-fixable retries park the
  failed child, restore the snapshot, and then re-establish the promised lifecycle route after
  resetting sibling residue. Repair prompts validate retained authority before they can reset a
  spec, and a plain child that puts a tracked spec back at Git baseline cannot erase pre-launch
  operator edits. Pre-existing untracked and ignored bound specs use that snapshot as their
  independent dirtiness oracle and are force-included only in the private recovery ref before
  restoration; index-only force-adds and cached removals also trigger cleanup, which restores the
  baseline index ownership. `rollback-owned-spec-restored` records the repair. Missing, unreadable,
  retargeted, changed external, or unsafe legacy authority pauses with convergent spec-adoption
  instructions, and recovery refuses a reset whose baseline would replace the canonical path or a
  parent directory with a symlink, tree, file, or other unsafe shape. An initial Sprint observation
  fault may leave a bare-key attempt unbound; an existing Stories folder+id target instead aborts
  unless it can be snapshotted. Post-bind faults abort before launch while retaining the authority
  for recovery. Protected rollback inventories and deletion replay remain byte-safe for POSIX
  filenames outside UTF-8. Snapshots are retired after commit. Other substantive changes and
  sibling source, artifact, or untracked residue still follow the configured rollback policy.

- **Recorded sprint re-drives now route directly through their known spec (#630).** Only a
  generic sprint task with a recorded `spec_file` names that `ready-for-dev` spec explicitly and
  pins deterministic read-back to the same file. Fresh sprint tasks with no recorded path remain
  bare-key dispatches; Stories stays folder+id, Sweep stays intent-bundle, and patch-restore plus
  verification-feedback routes retain their existing wording and precedence. A filesystem fault
  while observing the dispatch binding leaves that attempt unbound instead of aborting the run.

- **Accept canonical reachable-descendant spec baselines without trusting untracked residue.** An
  exact recorded baseline remains valid; any different real claim must uniquely resolve from 7–64
  hex characters to a direct immutable commit that descends from the recorded baseline and is
  reachable from `HEAD`. Symbolic or movable refs, ambiguous prefixes, non-commit objects, older,
  diverged, unknown, and off-HEAD claims remain refused, apart from the existing deferred-work
  bundle ancestor exception. Proof is re-anchored after an accepted descendant and counts only
  tracked, staged, or committed changes because the launch snapshot cannot date untracked files
  relative to that later claim. Shared-checkout mode proves later tracked work exists but cannot
  attribute it to one session; worktree isolation preserves that provenance. This accepts a skill
  stamp made after an intervening commit without letting stale untracked residue satisfy the gate.
  The same mismatch in the opposite direction is #640.

- **Overlong lowercase/kebab sweep bundle labels now proceed deterministically (#503).** An
  otherwise valid name over 40 characters is truncated to 40, journaled and persisted before
  validation, so the sweep proceeds without spending a feedback retry or pausing the run.
  Post-truncation collisions and other invalid shapes still fail validation.

- **Silent OpenCode parent sessions now enter bounded recovery from launch (#411).** Parent/child
  SSE activity and a provably busy or retrying parent re-arm the grace; true silence spends the
  bounded nudge budget and is classified `stalled`. This neither prevents upstream subagent
  interruption nor guarantees that best-effort `prompt_async` nudges wake it.

- **Generic and OpenCode dev/review stall grace now arms at launch and re-arms on activity (#470).**
  Pane/SSE activity and later turn-end evidence restart the grace, so a truly silent live session
  spends its configured bounded nudges and becomes `stalled` near the grace sequence instead of
  necessarily consuming all of `session_timeout_min`. Completion still requires Stop/idle evidence
  or window/server death plus deterministic artifact verification; prose never completes a session.

- **Dead targets no longer abort the generic completion loop from its two nudge sends (#504).** The
  stall and result-less-Stop sends alone contain `MultiplexerError`, after which deterministic
  liveness and artifact logic decides `crashed` or `stalled`; this is not blanket multiplexer failure
  tolerance.

- **Path-resolution refusals no longer tear down worktree runs mid-provisioning (#556).**
  Observation probes report coarse unknown entries, each refused seed is skipped independently,
  provisioning-root uncertainty raises a typed escalation and pauses before any write or session,
  and mount uncertainty defers only the affected unit. Required upstream-skill absence still
  escalates; this boundary does not include `ProjectPaths` or confined cleanup resolution.

- **Rollback path uncertainty now triggers a pre-destructive rollback pause (#557).** Trusted
  spec containment fails closed, observational exclude and story derivation use explicit
  fail-open or empty fallbacks, collision uncertainty keeps and escalates the branch, and exact
  commits omit only an uncertain candidate after a trusted root is established. This is limited
  to the audited verify and recovery boundaries, not every path-resolution call.

- **The dashboard now survives project-root resolution refusal with unavailable panes (#558).**
  Startup and polling retain empty or unavailable views through one stable lexical/canonical
  cache spelling. This preserves the dashboard around a dead provider; it does not recover the
  provider or make it operational.

- **Advancing a sprint board now preserves every authored line ending (#576).** A valid UTF-8
  board keeps each CRLF, LF, bare-CR or mixed per-line terminator while the requested story,
  conditional parent-epic and optional `last_updated` values still change. Previously the
  read/write relay could translate the whole board to the platform line ending, producing
  newline-only diff noise outside those intended value edits; parsed YAML content was not
  corrupted.

- **A `sweep --migrate` rewrite that drops a `gate:` token a pre-existing entry declared is now
  refused, instead of un-gating that story silently (#519).** Validation held the rewrite to each
  entry's id and status only, so losing the token passed, got committed, and the next dispatch ran
  the story the entry existed to hold back. The original ledger is now restored and the session
  re-prompted with the error, escalating after `max_migration_attempts` — a rewrite that previously
  passed can now fail. An _added_ token is still accepted, since over-blocking fails loudly and in
  the safe direction. Migration-scoped: every other ledger edit is still held by the format doc's
  instruction alone.

- **`sweep --migrate` now refuses a ledger that already carries duplicate `DW-<n>` ids, rather than
  migrating it into silent data loss (#519).** One id naming two entries cannot survive a migration
  either way: the rewrite that keeps both is rejected as duplicate, and the one that passes collapses
  them and drops a twin's `gate:`. The sweep now pauses before any rewrite is dispatched, naming the
  ids to renumber, and resumes with its migration budget intact. **A deliberate behavior change
  beyond #519's original scope:** such a migration completes today by losing that data, and will now
  stop instead. Bounded to ledgers that already carry duplicate ids.

- **An unrelated untracked file in your main checkout no longer blocks every isolated unit merge
  (#460).** Under `[scm] isolation = "worktree"` the pre-merge reconcile refused over any dirty path
  outside the unit branch's incoming set, untracked included, so a single `notes.txt` escalated the
  story and paused an unattended run. A merge writes only the paths that differ between target and
  branch and never stages an untracked file into the commit, so untracked dirt outside that set is
  now left where it is, the merge proceeds, and the run journals `merge-target-tolerated` naming it.
  Uncommitted changes to **tracked** files still escalate — `merge_strategy = "squash"` would fold
  them into the story's commit. Reaches dirt that appears after the run starts, and every `resume`.

- **The escalation that remains no longer blames a game engine (#460).** It asserted that "likely a
  Unity Editor wrote into the main project" on every isolated merge — the guard's origin story
  rather than a diagnosis, fired on repos with no Unity anywhere and no plugins loaded — and told
  you to "clean them", which is the exact verb the reconcile performs with `unlink` on its own
  paths. It now names the tracked files, asks you to commit, stash or revert them, and demotes a
  `per_worktree` engine Editor to one possible cause beside ordinary local work.

- **A git that warns while still exiting 0 no longer corrupts the answers the orchestrator reads
  back from it (#442).** An unknown `core.fsyncMethod` value or a `core.fsmonitor` hook that cannot
  exec is a property of the host's git config rather than a failure, but the shared git helper handed
  callers `stdout` and `stderr` merged — so every probe that read git's text as the ANSWER took the
  advisory for data. Silently: a rollback candidate list grew a phantom path, a commit list grew a
  phantom sha, and the sha and branch probes answered with the warning appended — the last of which
  reached the baselines persisted in run state, so a resume graded a warning-carrying string against
  a clean one and read "moved". Loudly: preserve-ref retention raised `PrunePreserveError`,
  `commit_paths` raised where its contract reports nothing to commit, and the worktree snapshot
  failed outright — which since #340 is a gate and not a safety net, so a noisy host had no working
  rollback at all. Thirteen value-reading probes now take stdout alone; the ~45 call sites that only
  check a return code are unchanged, and a failing git call still carries its stderr.

- **An indented, tab-separated or empty heading in the deferred-work ledger no longer lets a `gate:`
  below it hold a story the entry never named (#516).** A canonical entry ended only at a `#` run at
  column zero with exactly one space after it, so three shapes CommonMark spells as ATX headings —
  up to three spaces of indent, a tab as the separator, and an empty heading — ran on past the
  section header and absorbed the next section's field lines. A later `gate:` then landed in an open
  entry that had declared nothing: `validate` failed (`deferred.hard-gate`) and `run` paused
  (`story-gate`) on a story that entry never gated. Two reads move with the boundary: a `status:`
  below such a heading is now that section's rather than the entry's, so the entry parses with no
  status and leaves the open set; and a tail below one is no longer masked by an over-long span and
  reaches the legacy parser again. Four spaces of indent or a leading tab is an indented code block
  rather than a heading and still ends nothing, and a heading nested in a list item or a blockquote
  (`- ## Notes`) is still not a boundary either — the same line-scope limitation as #327.

- **Launching with a `--run-id` that already names a run is refused (#602).** The flag pointed at an
  existing run adopted that run's directory and published its own `state.json` over it. The id is
  now claimed exclusively as the directory is created, so a collision aborts the launch before
  anything is written and the earlier run is left untouched.

- **A launch that aborts while standing up its adapters no longer strands an empty run (#602).** An
  adapter failure left a run directory with no `run-start` that nothing reconciled, so it lingered
  in `bmad-loop list` looking resumable. Composition is now atomic from the first published
  artifact: on any escape the run directory and its out-of-tree state are removed and the original
  error is re-raised unchanged. The removal keeps the live-session guard, and a removal that itself
  fails is now reported instead of passing silently.

- **A failing auto-sweep can no longer kill its parent run, and a stop during one is no longer
  swallowed (#600, #601).** A `SystemExit` from the child — what an unusable multiplexer or an
  unresolvable profile raises — escaped every handler and ended the process at exit 1, leaving the
  parent neither `finished` nor `crashed` with an orphaned agent session. In the other direction a
  stop was recorded as a child failure, letting the parent run on to `finished` and leaving it
  unstoppable. `KeyboardInterrupt` deliberately still escapes.

- **A run's `sweeps_triggered` records only auto-sweeps that actually started (#501).** The trigger
  was spent before anything had been attempted, so every way a child could decline to launch
  consumed it — including a plain `git status` timeout, which fails closed and could silently burn
  a run's one and only sweep. The tree check now runs ahead of the record and journals a `reason`
  distinguishing a git fault from real local changes. Not a retry: what this buys is that
  `bmad-loop diagnose` stops reporting sweeps that never ran. A child that fails after its run
  directory exists still spends the trigger; the never-launched case journals
  `sweep-auto-not-started` and keeps its own notification.

- **A failed write can no longer truncate the sprint board, a story spec, your CLI settings or your
  policy file (#379).** Seven writers read a file, merged into it, and wrote the whole thing back
  through a truncating `Path.write_*` — so a fault partway through (ENOSPC, EIO, a quota) published
  a _prefix_ of the file and destroyed the rest. All seven now go through
  `platform_util.atomic_write_text` / `atomic_write_bytes`: contents to a temp, fsync, replace.

  Most of these fail _quietly_ — the file still parses afterwards, so nothing downstream raises:

  - **The sprint board.** `sprintstatus.advance` is the orchestrator's sole write path to
    `sprint-status.yaml`. YAML cut at a line boundary is still a valid mapping, just a smaller one,
    so the epics past the tear ceased to exist and the run walked off the end of the sprint instead
    of erroring.
  - **A story spec.** A spec is laid out `before + edited + after`, so a write that faulted after
    the frontmatter had landed left intact frontmatter saying `status: done` over a decapitated
    body — a spec that lies, which the loop then commits. `set_frontmatter_status`,
    `set_frontmatter_field` and `devcontract`'s four in-place rewriters now share one call.
    `devcontract` was already atomic and recorded the measured cost: fault injection on the old
    truncating write cut a 46-byte spec to 12.
  - **`.bmad-loop/policy.toml`.** `safe_rollback` captures it before the `git reset --hard` and
    writes it back after, so your orchestration config survives a rollback whether or not it was
    committed. A truncated TOML is not a smaller config — it is a parse error the next `run`
    refuses on, which is the failure the whole restore exists to prevent.
  - **The park records.** The engine restores a story's record when the commit it was written for
    fails. A record left truncated reads as a park owing nothing, while the board still says a
    human owes something.

  Your CLI's `settings.json` is the loud one. Both writers that register the completion hook —
  `init` and each isolated worktree's provisioning — parse the whole config, merge the relay into
  it, and write all of it back, so your permission allowlist, `env`, MCP entries and your own hooks
  survived only by round-tripping through that one call. JSON has no partial read — a prefix of an
  object is a parse error, not a smaller object — so this was never silent, just unrecoverable:
  `init` refused on the next run with `is not valid JSON; fix it and re-run init`, pointing you at
  a file it had shredded itself, and refusing _before_ the merge meant re-running could not rebuild
  it. In a worktree it was quieter and worse — nothing re-reads that copy, so the session started
  against unparseable settings, the CLI fell back to its defaults, the Stop hook was never
  registered, and the run idled to timeout with nothing naming the cause.

  Three of the seven are **put-backs**: they restore a file _after_ something has already failed,
  which is the worst possible moment for a second loss. One of them, the engine's restore of a park
  record after a failed commit, now journals its own failure as `park-record-rollback-failed`
  rather than dropping it. Nothing else would ever surface that — `validate` reports a board parked
  with no record, but never a record left over for a park that is in no commit.

- **Four writers under `.bmad-loop/` no longer strand an untracked temp when their replace fails
  (#363).** Each built a fixed-name temp and then `os.replace`d it, and `atomic_replace` does no
  cleanup of its own. No ignore rule covers those names — `init` writes `.bmad-loop/runs/`,
  `.bmad-loop/cache/`, `.bmad-loop/policy.toml` and `_bmad/render/` — so a failed replace left an
  untracked file holding `verify.worktree_clean` False until a human deleted it by hand.

  - Three route through the helpers, which name the temp uniquely per write and remove it on any
    raise: the pre-answer store (`.bmad-loop/decisions.json`), `policy.toml`'s `[mux] backend`
    writer, and the TUI settings editor's save. The last two built the _same_
    `.bmad-loop/policy.toml.tmp` path, so they could also collide with each other.
  - `archive_run` keeps writing its own tarball — the path goes to `tarfile.open`, so there is no
    payload for a helper to take — and gains the unlink-on-raise guard instead. Its temp was also
    misnamed: `with_suffix` replaces only the last suffix, so `<id>.tar.gz` yielded
    `<id>.tar.tar.gz.tmp`. It is now `<id>.tar.gz.tmp`.

  Under a monorepo `repo_root:` override this surfaces as a failing `validate` and TUI rather than
  a blocked `run`: `run` and `sweep` probe the repo root, `validate` and the TUI probe the project.

  Five more temp-and-replace writers took the same helper without having been exposed: the sweep's
  two `decisions.json` writes, whose file is the per-run one under the gitignored
  `.bmad-loop/runs/<id>/` and not the project-level store named above; the two park-record writers
  behind `bmad-loop confirm` and `drop`, which already carried a hand-rolled guard; and
  `devcontract`'s spec writer. All five gain the fsync before the replace and a unique temp name in
  place of a fixed `.tmp` sibling that two concurrent writers would collide on.

  **Scope, for both entries above.** This closes the _raise_ path, and only that. The helpers stage
  at `mkstemp(dir=target.parent, suffix=".tmp")`, so a `SIGKILL` mid-write still strands a temp
  that `worktree_clean` reads as dirty; and on Windows `os.replace` is
  `MoveFileEx(MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING)`, which is not guaranteed atomic and may fall back to a
  non-atomic copy. What holds everywhere is that a failed write cannot truncate the original.

- **An atomic write no longer fails on a file whose name fills the filesystem's limit (#595).** The
  helpers stage a temp named after their target, and `mkstemp` inserts eight random characters, so
  the temp ran `len(name) + 13` — long enough that a target with a perfectly legal name produced an
  illegal _temp_ name and the write died with `ENAMETOOLONG` — or, on Windows, with `ENOENT`
  carrying `winerror` 206, which is the same condition under a different name. On ext4 the cutoff
  was a 243-byte basename.
  Latent in the helpers since they were written, and reachable from this release because the story
  spec writers moved onto them: a spec is named by your planning skills, and nothing bounds that
  name. When the readable temp name cannot fit, the helpers now fall back to a short digest of it
  rather than failing — the OS decides, so there is no guess at a per-filesystem byte limit.

- **A best-effort diagnostic write no longer takes the run down, and POSIX tmux captures no longer
  raise on an undecodable byte (#380).** Both halves are one defect: an exception net that names one
  direction of the Unicode hierarchy while the other escapes it. `_append_diag_jsonl` serializes
  with `ensure_ascii=False` and writes through a UTF-8 handle, so a story spec whose filename holds
  a byte the filesystem codec could not decode arrived surrogate-escaped and failed at the encode
  with `UnicodeEncodeError` — a `UnicodeError`, so a `ValueError`, not an `OSError` — straight past
  a guard whose stated contract is that an unwritable run dir must never break the completion loop.
  The guard is now `(OSError, UnicodeError)` and the breadcrumb is dropped instead of crashing the
  run. Separately and visibly: `tmux_base`'s `_ERRORS` was the strict handler on POSIX while the
  Windows backend already set `"backslashreplace"`, so a capture holding such a byte raised out of
  the one place tmux is spawned; it now comes back with that byte rendered as a `\xNN` escape, and a
  session name or window title carrying one reads back escaped. Fixing the decode at its source
  rather than at the fourteen catch sites is deliberate — most of them return a sentinel, so
  catching there would have converted a crash into a wrong answer (`[]` reads as "window dead").
  `_ENCODING` stays `None`, so POSIX keeps the locale codec and only stops being strict. This closes
  the diagnostic writer and the capture decode; it does not sweep the wider `except`-tuple family.

- **A plugin hook or version probe whose child emits a non-UTF-8 byte no longer crashes the run
  (#383).** `subprocess.run(..., text=True)` decodes with the locale codec at `errors="strict"`, and
  the `UnicodeDecodeError` that raises is neither an `OSError` nor a `SubprocessError`, so it
  escaped both captures' guards. The declarative-hook transport is the run-crashing half: `_HookError`
  is the bus's designed channel for "the hook could not run to completion", and the decode happens
  after the child has exited — so a hook that actually **passed** took its exit code down with the
  run instead of being classified. `probe.run_version_help` documents "Never raises", and a
  `--version`/`--help` banner carrying such a byte made that false. Both now decode with
  `errors="replace"`, so the hook's verdict survives and a fault is classified through the normal
  channel. Visible change: those bytes now show as `�` (U+FFFD) in journal entries, hook advisory
  text and probe documents. The `except` tuples are deliberately not widened — the fix is to stop
  raising, and a widened tuple would guard a fault nothing could ablate into existence.

- **A session whose log merely writes _about_ a provider error no longer pauses the run (#507).**
  `claude` shipped one pattern joining a framing token to a cause across an unbounded `.*`, and this
  adapter scans a tmux pane capture — the model's own output — so any line mentioning both halves
  classified. 44 of this repo's own tracked lines did, most of them ordinary pytest/grep/diff output.
  The harm ran the other way: a **genuine** timeout was read as an environment fault, re-arming the
  budget and halting the run for an operator instead of charging the attempt. The three replacements
  reproduce only complete error sentences Claude Code was captured printing, 5xx statuses enumerated
  rather than ranged. A standing guard walks `git ls-files` and asserts no tracked line classifies —
  write the framing token and a cause separated (`API Error` … `<cause>`) in future entries.

- **A mid-response connection drop or a provider 5xx refusal on the `claude` adapter now pauses the
  run with the matched evidence (#323).** The withdrawn connection-only pattern caught 2 of the 5
  captured Claude Code failure lines, so a session killed by either of those three misses was charged
  a dev attempt, and `max_dev_attempts` of them deferred a story whose spec and code were fine. All
  five classify now, and the pause re-arms the budget instead of spending it. A subscription
  usage-limit / quota refusal is still **not** classified on this adapter: no captured Claude Code
  quota line exists to seed a pattern from, and on a pane capture that vocabulary is what a story
  _implementing_ rate limiting prints all day — follow-up: #610. The four unseeded profiles
  (`codex`, `gemini`, `copilot`, `antigravity`) are unchanged and still ship none.

- **An out-of-tree module that claims a bundled transport's name is no longer driven in the bundled
  backend's place (#565).** Backend selection breaks ties on registration order, and the bundled
  `tmux` / `psmux` entries were seeded only on the first multiplexer resolution — so any
  registration that landed before it owned that name, and the whole process silently ran on a
  third-party transport. The trigger is reachable rather than theoretical: a plugin's `[python]`
  module is executed in-process by the plugin registry, which has no ordering relationship to when
  the mux is first resolved. Registering a backend now seeds the bundled ones first, making
  builtins-first an invariant of the registration itself rather than a property of which import ran
  first — the same fix the adapter registry already carries. A shadowing external is still
  registered, just behind the bundled entry.

- **Two broken distributions that publish the same entry-point name no longer collapse to a single
  recorded error (#566).** `importlib.metadata` does not deduplicate entry points across
  distributions, and all three external-load scans — adapters, profiles and mux backends — recorded
  failures by assignment into a name-keyed map, so the second failing package overwrote the first.
  You fixed the one failure you were shown, then met the other on the next run with nothing saying
  it had ever been there. Both reasons now surface, and every recorded external-load failure names
  its **distribution** when one is resolvable — in `bmad-loop adapters`, `bmad-loop mux`,
  `validate`'s human output and `validate --json` — because the entry-point name is not the
  distribution you uninstall.

  The limit, plainly: two failing same-named distributions still produce **one** finding and one
  warning line, whose text now carries both reasons `"; "`-joined. The row count does not double.
  That is what keeps the change contract-preserving — `detail`'s key set and value types are
  unchanged, so `VALIDATE_SCHEMA_VERSION` stays 1.

  **A deliberate scope addition:** the multiplexer's entry-point scan is now ordered by (name,
  distribution), as the adapter and profile scans already were, so which of two same-named
  distributions is recorded first is a fact about the packages rather than about `sys.path`.

- **A run launch whose adapter class rejects a bootstrap keyword now aborts on a clean `error:`
  line instead of a bare traceback (#569).** The construct call converted only the failures an
  adapter family declares, and a signature mismatch is refused by the interpreter rather than by
  the family — so an out-of-tree class whose `__init__` does not accept a keyword the bootstrap
  passes escaped uncaught. The abort now names the profile, the adapter kind and the rejected
  keyword; the exit code is unchanged at 1. Deliberately unchanged: a `TypeError` raised from
  inside a working `__init__` still surfaces as itself, because that is a bug in that package
  rather than a declared failure, and relabelling it as a signature mismatch would bury it. This is
  message quality only — an error escaping here already unwound the composition it had started.

- **A modal dialog on a terminal narrower than its declared width now shrinks to fit instead of
  being clipped, so its action buttons stay reachable (#281).** The docked button row is
  right-aligned, so the buttons were exactly what fell off the right edge — the horizontal twin of
  the vertical defect #275/#280 fixed. `EscalationModal` needed 87 columns, so a standard
  80-column terminal already clipped it outright; `DecisionModal` needed 83 and the bounded
  confirms 61. Below 60 columns those buttons additionally render smaller and tighter, because
  clamping the dialog alone still leaves a three-button row demanding 54 columns inside a content
  region narrower than that.

  On the other axis, below 20 rows a dialog now renders in a compact layout — collapsed padding,
  no title margin, a one-row button row — rather than clipping its docked buttons and safety
  warnings. `docs/tui-guide.md` accordingly records the terminal sizes these dialogs were measured
  at — **39 columns × 9 rows** for a dialog's own chrome — stated as sizes measured to be
  sufficient rather than as a supported minimum, and scoped to the dialogs, not the dashboard
  behind them. `EscalationModal` sets that figure and it is width-dependent, its docked warning
  wrapping to 9 rows at 39 columns but 6 at 80. Titles, headers and paths dock outside the
  scrolling body, so a long enough one wraps and costs rows the body cannot give back: a
  ~300-character deferred-work heading clips the close button, the validate viewer grows with its
  document's spec folder (#629), and the spec viewer's `copy path` button plus its action verbs
  simply do not fit 39 columns (#628). Nothing bounds that caller-supplied text, so no fixed size
  is a minimum these dialogs will always meet; a standard 80 × 24 terminal absorbed every measured
  example and the guide quotes it on those terms. At 60 columns and 20 rows and above the full
  chrome renders exactly as it does today.

- **A deferred-work bundle whose name or key ends in a newline is now rejected instead of becoming a
  directory (#330).** Both sweep regexes anchored with `$`, which in Python also matches just before
  a single trailing newline, and every call site uses `.match()`. So a bundle named `fix-it\n`
  validated clean and was used unsanitized as both the `run_dir/bundles/<name>/` path segment —
  invalid on native Windows — and the `dw-<name>` story key, while a key of `dw-foo\n` silently
  rebuilt a degraded bundle's intent under the different directory `foo`. Both patterns now anchor
  with `\Z`. Only a name or key ending in exactly one bare LF flips to rejected; `\r\n`, `\n\n`, a
  bare `\r`, a trailing space and any interior newline already were. A cached triage carrying such a
  name now re-runs instead of crashing, and a pre-fix run-state task keyed that way becomes inert
  rather than re-driven under a silently different name. Sweep-scoped: a bundle name is still not
  guaranteed safe as a path segment.

## [0.10.0] — 2026-08-14

Much of this section is the `release/0.9.x` hotfix line brought forward onto `main` (#433).
**Upgrading from 0.9.1, you already have those fixes** — the entries below re-state them for `main`,
whose seams had diverged enough that several ports needed a different fix, and they close holes
0.9.1 left open. `main` has not been released since 0.9.0 and does not descend from v0.9.1.

### Added

- **Hook events move out of the project tree (#494).** A run's session-completion signals now land
  under a user-scoped state root — `$XDG_STATE_HOME/bmad-loop`, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\bmad-loop\state`, or
  an absolute `BMAD_LOOP_STATE_DIR` — so a branch switch, a worktree mount or a rollback can no
  longer take a live run's control plane away. Relays predating the move keep working through an
  in-tree fallback until you re-run `bmad-loop init`; `validate` flags a stale one as
  `hooks.relay-stale`, and `delete`/`archive`/`clean` collect the new directory with the run
  (`clean --json` gains `state_dirs_swept`).

- **`bmad-loop relay <Event>` records a session event without the copied-in script (#494).** It
  keeps the script's contract: nothing on stdout, rc 0 always, a silent no-op outside a driven
  session. `init` does not point hooks at it yet, so no run behaves differently today.

- **A coding-CLI adapter class can ship out-of-tree (#226).** A profile's new `adapter` field names
  a kind resolved against the adapter registry, so a co-installed package can register its own
  driving class — and the profile that selects it — with no core edit, as the transport axis has
  long allowed. `bmad-loop adapters` lists the registered kinds and the profiles selecting them,
  `validate` gains `adapter.kind` and `adapter.external` reports, and a broken third-party package
  degrades to a surfaced reason instead of breaking selection.

- **A deferred-work entry can block stories from running: `gate:`.** A `gate: 3-2, 3-3` line names
  the story keys that must wait for the entry, and both `validate` (`deferred.hard-gate`) and `run`
  (a `story-gate` pause) enforce it — the prose `HARD GATE:` convention stopped nothing. Closing the
  entry or dropping the token clears it, sweeps are exempt because a sweep is what closes the entry,
  and a gate that can enforce nothing warns as `deferred.hard-gate-unstructured`.

- **Deferred review findings are harvested from spec frontmatter (#433).** A successful dev, review,
  repair or review-timeout-salvage pass files each item from the spec's `deferred:` list into the
  ledger as `### DW-<n>`, so findings triaged as `defer` reach the sweep instead of stopping at the
  spec. Retries and replays never re-file, malformed items collapse into one `severity: low` entry,
  and a spec outside the orchestrator's roots is refused.

- **A park record travels with its story's commit (#356).** Each parked story writes
  `.bmad-loop/operator/<key>.json` inside the story's own commit window, so `bmad-loop confirm`
  works from any clone; the machine-local `operator-actions.json` index is retired — still read and
  pruned, never written. `validate` reports a park with no record as `operator.park-record-missing`;
  pull the park commit's branch if that is what you are missing.

- **Stories can park at `awaiting-operator`, and `bmad-loop confirm` completes them (#335).** A dev
  session whose story needs an action only a human can take outside the repo — publish a DNS record,
  grant an API key — now commits everything an agent can do, records what is owed in the spec's
  `operator_actions:` frontmatter, and parks so the run moves on, in place of a dishonest `done` or
  a run-halting `blocked`. Once you have carried the external work out, `bmad-loop confirm
<story-key>` walks the actions (`--yes` skips the prompts, `--reverify` re-runs `[verify]` first
  and blocks on failure, `--list`/`--json` show what is parked), advances the spec and board to
  `done` and commits the pair; `[operator] enabled = false` reverts. Run state carrying the new
  phase is forward-only — an older bmad-loop rejects it.

- **Defer notifications name the branch where the work survives (#333).** A deferred story's
  rollback parks the attempt on `attempt-preserve/*`, but the ref only ever reached `journal.jsonl`,
  leaving you to hunt with `git log --all`; the notice now names the ref and the
  `git merge --ff-only` that restores it. New `preserve_ref` on each task is projected into `status`
  and `--json` (additive; schema stays 1).

- **Stories can close deferred-work entries (#234).** `closes_deferred: [DW-5, DW-6]` on a
  `stories.yaml` entry or in a spec's frontmatter flips each named entry to `status: done` with a
  `resolution:` naming the story, at the story's commit. Advisory: a failed or escalated story
  closes nothing, bad ids only warn and `validate` reports them up front
  (`deferred.closes-unknown`), and no upstream skill emits the field yet (BMAD-METHOD#2619).

- **Readable run logs for `opencode-http` (#306).** Contributed by
  [@jackmcintyre](https://github.com/jackmcintyre). The HTTP adapter has no tmux pane to replay, so
  a finished run left `logs/<task-id>.log` holding nothing but the server's own INFO stdout; the SSE
  stream now also yields a curated role-prefixed transcript, a `<task-id>.server.out` and a raw
  `<task-id>.sse.jsonl` trace.

- **`review.on_timeout` policy knob (#271).** A timeout-like review verdict (`timeout`, `stalled`,
  `over_budget`) burned every review cycle before deferring, even when the dev product was already
  finalized and verify-green. Beside the default `"retry"`, `"salvage-if-done"` commits the verified
  product and refiles the outstanding recommendation to deferred work, and `"defer"` gives up on the
  first such verdict.

- **Transport failures pause the run instead of burning attempts (#194).** A session whose CLI lost
  its API connection stayed alive but idle until the session clock ran out, so two outages could
  exhaust `max_dev_attempts` and defer a story untouched. Adapters classify it from per-profile
  `env_fault_patterns` and pause like an `rc 126/127` verify fault; re-arming restores the budget.

- **Raw psmux premise probes (#488).** The zero-token Windows live gate now flags the workarounds a
  current psmux no longer needs, so they can be dropped on evidence rather than kept on suspicion.

- **`python -m bmad_loop` (#240).** The package is runnable as a module, mirroring the installed
  `bmad-loop` console script.

- **`{story_title}` in `scm.commit_message_template` (#475).** The placeholder renders the spec's
  `title:` frontmatter minus any leading `Story <id>:` label, so a commit subject can carry a
  readable title. It never renders empty and never fails a commit — a spec that is missing,
  unreadable or lacks the field falls back to a first `#` heading and then to the story key, and
  characters `git commit -m` cannot take in an argv are dropped.

### Changed

- **Docs state the deferred-work contract of the 6.11 era (#567).** The sweep's format doc,
  FEATURES.md, the setup guide and the module skills now name `bmad-build-auto` and describe the
  spec-frontmatter harvest it uses, keeping the legacy spelling only where a pre-rename install
  still needs it. Prose only, no behavior change.

- **docs/testing.md states the testing strategy.** Layer taxonomy and placement rules, fixture and
  ablation doctrine, the quality-guard inventory, and the zero-token and flake policy; AGENTS.md,
  docs/README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md link to it.

- **The `BMAD_LOOP_*` environment variables are documented and centrally registered (#246).** The
  three runtime override vars — `BMAD_LOOP_MUX_BACKEND`, `BMAD_LOOP_PROCESS_HOST`,
  `BMAD_LOOP_SESSION_TIMEOUT_S` — now have a reference table in the README and are read through one
  registry, so the supported knobs are discoverable in one place. Behavior is unchanged.

- **The supported tmux floor is 3.2.** It was never written down, so the only floor a reader could
  infer was whatever the argv grammar happens to accept — older than anything the project tests. No
  version gate gets added: an older tmux is not refused up front, it is simply unsupported.

- **The mid-run config pin covers the adapter kind (#461).** `adapter` selects which argv builder
  runs at all, so it joins the `config_digest` launch payload — a driven session that rewrites it
  now moves the pin the auto-triggered child sweep gates on, instead of swapping the whole launch
  shape underneath it.

- **`validate`'s httpx and model-format checks key on the adapter kind, not hooklessness (#226).**
  Both are facts about the `opencode-http` class rather than about whether a profile registers
  hooks, so a hookless profile driven by another kind no longer FAILs with a remedy that installs
  the wrong package, nor warns about a naming convention it does not use. An `opencode-http` profile
  carrying a hook dialect now gets the model warning it always needed.

- **A hookless profile can no longer wait out the clock on the `generic` adapter (#226).** `generic`
  completes on a Stop hook that `hooks.dialect = "none"` never registers, so both routes into the
  profile map refuse the pair outright rather than passing `validate` and then idling until
  `session_timeout_min`. A pre-`adapter` overlay copied from the packaged opencode profile resolves
  to `opencode-http` instead of that dead pairing; an explicit `adapter` is always honored, and
  hookless on any other kind stays legal.

- **Profiles from a `bmad_loop.profiles` entry point are validated like TOML ones (#226).** Both
  routes share one invariant set — hook dialect, path containment, `env_fault_patterns` compilation,
  canonical `name`/`binary`/`adapter` — so a package can no longer install a profile state the TOML
  parser would refuse, such as an invalid env-fault regex that trades a load-time error for a silent
  never-match at classification time.

- **An unreadable deferred-work ledger fails `validate` rather than warning.** The `gate:` hard gate
  rides on the same bytes, so `deferred.ledger-unreadable` as a warning exited 0 with the gate never
  evaluated — a fail-open on the one deferred check that refuses. `run` pauses on the same fault, so
  preflight and dispatch now agree.

- **Every spec-frontmatter status read goes through `status_of` (#358 follow-up).** Five inline
  reads remained in the engine and the generic adapter, each taking a blank `status:` as the token
  `none`. One behavior change falls out: a session that erases a previously-set status no longer
  records a transition, because a blank is not an observed live status.

- **The story token budget is checked while the story runs (#336).** `max_tokens_per_story` was read
  once, after the story was marked done, so an overrun surfaced only after every token was spent and
  a story that deferred or escalated went unchecked. Cumulative weighted spend is now re-checked at
  every session boundary, raising one ATTENTION plus a desktop notice, latched per story; still
  advisory — `limits.max_tokens_per_session` remains the session-ending cap.

- **A failed snapshot blocks the rollback reset (#340).** An auto-rollback refused to reset past
  commits it could not park, yet journaled a failed _uncommitted_-work snapshot and reset anyway,
  destroying the tracked edits and run-created files that snapshot existed to capture. Both preserve
  steps now refuse alike, pausing with rescue instructions naming the tree; inert under shipped
  defaults, this bites `scm.rollback_on_failure = true` and in-worktree retries.

- **A review that revokes the sprint sign-off escalates (#334).** `sprint-status` is advanced to
  `done` at dev time, so a review session writing it back left the remaining cycles re-reading the
  same failure until the story deferred and its work rolled back. The review-verify gate now pauses
  with the two ways out — finish and re-arm, or accept and advance the board — under a new
  `[review] on_status_contradiction` (default `escalate`; `retry` restores the old behavior).

- **`bmad-loop-setup` stops registering BMAD config; the installer owns it (#258).** The skill wrote
  the pre-v6.10 `_bmad/config.yaml` layout that BMAD's own resolver never reads, and since v6.10.0
  the installer stages the module and regenerates `config.toml` wholesale, discarding outside
  writes. Its PEP 723 scripts go with it, closing the bare-`python3` bug (#259); setup now writes
  one help CSV, installs the tool and preflights.

- **Ctrl+C outside a run exits `130` cleanly (#241).** A `KeyboardInterrupt` escaping `main()`
  during config load or engine construction now prints a one-line `interrupted` to stderr and
  returns the new `ExitCode.INTERRUPTED`, in place of a bare traceback dumped after any partial
  `--json` stdout. The shell exit code is unchanged, but a Python caller's `subprocess.returncode`
  now reads `130` rather than `-2`; Ctrl+C _during_ a run is unaffected.

### Removed

- **The `bmad-auto` → `bmad-loop` rename shims are gone.** The rename shipped in 0.8.0 and no
  pre-rename installs remain in the wild, so `init` no longer strips `bmad_auto`-marked hooks,
  deletes `bmad-auto-*` skill dirs, carries `.automator/policy.toml` over to `.bmad-loop/`, or
  prints the leftover-`.automator/` note, and `bmad-loop-setup` drops its migration section. A
  project still on `bmad-auto` should migrate on 0.9.1 — the last release carrying the shims —
  before upgrading past it.

### Fixed

- **The settings editor's `review.trigger` help no longer names a dev primitive that may be absent.**
  Its `recommended` blurb said "only when bmad-dev-auto flags it", a name upstream retired in BMAD
  6.10.1 but still correct on the 6.10.0 support floor — either spelling is wrong for the other era.
  It now says "the dev pass", matching the adjacent `review.enabled` description and the
  `docs/tui-guide.md` table it mirrors; the `policy.toml` template `init` writes got the same fix.

- **The `version-sync` gate no longer passes on a marketplace.json it could not read.**
  `sync_version.check()` iterated `market.get("plugins", [])`, so a renamed, deleted or emptied
  `plugins` key made the loop run zero times and the gate print "ok: every version field agrees"
  — green on exactly the corruption it exists to catch, including when a real stale version sat
  behind the renamed key. It now refuses a `plugins` value that is not a non-empty list, and
  reports a non-object entry instead of raising. Covered by a new `tests/test_sync_version.py`.

- **`trunk check` is documented as the changed-files check it is.** `AGENTS.md` and
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` both called it "full lint, no path filter", but bare `trunk check` lints only
  files changed against the upstream — 7 of 254 on the branch that fixed this — and CI's
  `trunk-action` defaults the same way. `--all` is the whole-repo run, and both files now say so.
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` also no longer claims `release.py check` rejects a hand-authored version
  section (it returns 0 on one), tells maintainers that `prepare` refuses until they promote the
  CHANGELOG by hand, and stops presenting three commands as the complete set of CI gates.

- **Contributor docs now name every obligation CI enforces.** `CONTRIBUTING.md` never mentioned
  `pyright` or the CHANGELOG, so its verify step — "`trunk check` and `uv run pytest -q` both
  pass" — sent contributors into a CI failure on the dedicated typecheck job. It now carries
  `uv run pyright`, the `## [Unreleased]` CHANGELOG contract, the Windows `PYTHONUTF8=1`
  requirement and the Python 3.11 floor, the real extras (`tui`, `non-linux`, `opencode` — it
  claimed only `tui`), and `scripts/release.py`'s two-phase `prepare`/`publish` flow. The pull
  request template gains a matching Changelog section, as does CONTRIBUTING's copy of it.

- **The docs no longer describe a state the code has left behind.** The README's command table
  gained `bmad-loop adapters`, and its docs list gained five missing guides plus `docs/README.md`,
  the full index. `docs/FEATURES.md` now covers all 15 policy sections rather than 12 — `[dev]` was
  documented nowhere. The roadmap's native-Windows entry read `planned` while its own body said
  psmux had shipped, and `AGENTS.md` counted `~25` leaf modules where there are 28.

- **A failed ledger write can no longer empty the deferred-work ledger (#328).** Every write built
  its replacement in place, so an unencodable value, `ENOSPC` or `EIO` partway through left a
  zero-byte ledger with every entry gone. Writes are now atomic — a failure raises with the original
  untouched — and a ledger created from nothing lands `0600` rather than at the umask default.

- **A lone surrogate in triage text no longer crashes the sweep (#329).** A code point with no UTF-8
  encoding at all could reach the ledger through a cached triage result and take down a close path
  that had no guard. Every free-text ledger field and the whole of a bundle's `intent.md` now
  neutralize such characters to `�`, so the text stays visible instead of ending the sweep.

- **A `#` inside a quoted sprint-status value is no longer rewritten into a comment (#366).**
  Advancing `3-2-x: "a # b"` produced `3-2-x: done # b"`, promoting scalar text into a comment the
  board never had. A quote-led value is now taken whole with no comment recognized inside it;
  unquoted values keep the wide class this board needs and still cede the first whitespace-preceded
  `#` as authored.

- **A gitignored sprint board no longer crashes a worktree-isolated run (#350).** A worktree checks
  out tracked files only, so the board the orchestrator advances was simply absent: the advance
  no-opped in silence and the run then died on the same missing file. The board is now seeded into
  the worktree and the story's advance re-applied to the main checkout after the merge — journaled
  `board-advance-carried`, or `board-advance-carry-uncommitted` where git refuses the ignored path
  (the ordinary outcome for such a board), or `board-advance-carry-failed` where the main row never
  reached the target. Without that carry the next run reads the main board and hands you the
  finished story again. Tracked boards are unaffected.

- **`confirm` no longer loses its commit to a gitignored board (#577).** Confirming a park on such a
  board printed `✓ confirmed` while the spec's flip to `done` and the park record's deletion stayed
  uncommitted, dirtying the tree the next run's preflight refuses. The board is now left out of that
  commit when git will not take it — a force-tracked board still commits — and is advanced on disk
  either way.

- **`resume`'s config-change baseline moves out of the agent-writable tree (#498).** The baseline
  `resume` compares against — verify commands, launch binary/args/env, plugin allowlist —
  round-tripped through `state.json`, inside the very tree the digest exists to police, so a session
  that rewrote `policy.toml` could blank the field in the same breath and the warning never fired.
  It now lives in the run's out-of-tree state dir (#494) and is collected by the same
  `delete`/`archive`/`clean` lifecycle; `state.json` keeps a copy consulted **only** when no
  out-of-tree file exists, which covers a run paused under an older version and a project that has
  been moved or renamed (#572). This closes the _incidental_ path only — sessions launch with
  permission bypass by default and are handed the state dir's location, so a deliberate one can
  still silence the warning; closing that needs privilege separation, tracked in #571.

- **Worktree runs no longer stall when a seeded hook config carries the main repo's relay (#352).**
  The seeded `.claude/settings.json` arrived naming a relay path that resolves inside the worktree,
  where none exists, so the session emitted no hook events and idled out the session clock. Relay
  entries are now stripped from the seeded config before merging, and a project that _tracks_ its
  hook config gets the same rewrite pinned `skip-worktree` so the machine-specific command never
  folds into a story commit — while pinned, the config is orchestrator-owned and a story's own edit
  to it stays session-local.

- **`cleanup` no longer reports a surviving ctl window as removed (#435).** Killing a window reports
  nothing, so the prune counted every _attempted_ kill as a removal. It now verifies with one
  liveness listing and partitions into `removed` / `survived` / `unverifiable`, so
  `CLEANUP_SCHEMA_VERSION` is **2** and text mode names the two non-removed arms on stderr. A
  candidate scan that fails outright reports `ctl_windows.scan_error` with empty arms, so a
  preflight failure is never the same document as "nothing to prune"; `sessions.removed` is
  untouched and still an attempted kill.

- **A crashed version probe is distinguishable from "reports no version" (#428).** A binary on
  `PATH` that dies answering `-V` — corrupt install, AV-blocked exe, hung server — collapsed to the
  same answer a quiet binary gives, and its stderr was gone. `bmad-loop mux` now prints the dropped
  diagnostic as a `warning:` line on stderr below the table, since the `-` in the VERSION column
  cannot say which of the two happened.

- **A project path the OS refuses to canonicalize no longer kills every command (#552).** On a
  Windows host whose WSL UNC provider is registered but not serving, resolving `\\wsl$\<distro>\...`
  fails outright — and that resolve runs before dispatch, so every subcommand died at the backstop,
  `diagnose` and `validate` included: the `host.win32-on-wsl-path` warning naming the fault was
  unreachable on the only hosts it is for. Those commands now degrade to an absolute path with one
  note on stderr and run. Config loading refuses instead, with a typed error every caller already
  handles: a degraded root beside a canonically spelled artifact path mis-files an in-tree directory
  as external and sends a worktree-isolated run's writes into the original checkout. The paths that
  need a canonical answer downstream — run tagging, worktree provisioning, verify — still raise, so
  nothing tags one project two ways.

- **`BMAD_LOOP_SESSION_TIMEOUT_S=inf` no longer disables the session timeout.** The guard rejected a
  non-positive value but let `inf`, `1e999` and `Infinity` through, producing a deadline that could
  never expire — and that budget is the outer bound every stall-grace and wake-nudge window defers
  to, so an unattended run could wedge with no backstop left. The value must now be finite and
  positive, otherwise falling back to `limits.session_timeout_min` as it already did for `0` and
  unparseable input. A large _finite_ value is still honoured.

- **A tab in the project path no longer truncates the project tag a window listing carries.** The
  multiplexer listing is tab-delimited and the tag holds a resolved filesystem path, where a tab is
  a legal byte — so the tag came back truncated and read as another project's, and the prune scan
  then skipped the project's own parked control windows. The last requested field now keeps its
  delimiters.

- **Removing a run directory no longer strands a session that outlived its engine (#526).**
  `delete`, `archive` and `clean` gated on engine-pid liveness, which an orphan — engine dead, agent
  session still alive — passes; for an untagged session the run dir is the last ownership proof a
  prune can read, so removing it leaked the session for the life of the machine. Removal now refuses
  while a `bmad-loop-<run-id>` session the project cannot prove foreign is live, and `clean` leaves
  the run untouched; `--force` overrides the refusal and kills nothing, since a session name carries
  no project.

- **A project path the multiplexer cannot carry no longer strands the scans over it (#419).** The
  ownership tag held the resolved path, which psmux's control line refuses when it names a spaced
  UNC share and which a listing row can split on an exotic separator or fail to decode — either way
  the session or window went untagged, leaking once `clean` removed its run dir and prunable by
  another project on a reused `--run-id`. The tag is now a 16-hex digest of the path, safe on both
  transports by construction; pruning still accepts the legacy path tag, so state surviving the
  upgrade keeps its ownership; reading a legacy raw tag is the decode half (#380).

- **A run id that is a suffix of another no longer resolves to the neighbour's control window.**
  `--run-id` is caller-supplied and may contain `-`, so `run-other-RID` satisfied the lookup for
  `RID` and sorted ahead of it — `bmad-loop x` could kill the neighbouring run's live orchestrator.
  Window names are now parsed and the run id compared whole, as the prune scan already did.

- **Attach, return-stamp and kill follow the run's live control window, not an older one (#482).**
  Window names are not unique, so the lookup answered the first match: `a`, the return stamp and `x`
  all landed on a parked run's dead window while the live one ran on. Each launch now records the
  window id it minted and the lookup prefers it, and a resume whose id was not captured warns rather
  than reporting plain success. **Adapter authors:** the re-prove pairs `new_parked_window`'s id
  with the `window_id` column of `list_windows`, which the seam previously left free to diverge — a
  backend where they differ degrades to the by-name resolve.

- **Diagnose a lost multiplexer session on the crash path (#489).** A dead window and a session
  destroyed under the run — a reaper, this tool's own prune, an operator `kill-session`, a server
  crash — both scored `crashed` and read as an agent fault. A crash verdict now probes for the
  session and carries `session_vanished` in the failure reason, on every role's `session-end` entry
  and as a `session-vanished` breadcrumb, composed with an environment-fault pause. It also reaches
  the repair path's exhaustion defer, which otherwise blamed the tree for repairs that never ran.
  Diagnosis only: routing is unchanged and a retry re-creates the session.

- **A native-Windows install driven from a WSL shell now says so (#332).** WSL appends the Windows
  `PATH` to its own, so a bash prompt can reach a Windows-installed `bmad-loop` that takes the psmux
  platform default and never sees the distro's tmux — while `validate` printed a green multiplexer
  line and nothing named the platform. `validate` now reports the multiplexer selection reason for
  **every** host, so `platform default for win32` is on screen wherever the mismatch happens, and a
  `fallback` selection is a warning rather than a green line. A `win32` interpreter working on a
  `\\wsl.localhost\...` project additionally raises `host.win32-on-wsl-path` naming the fix (install
  with the WSL/Linux Python) and the backend it actually chose; `diagnose` gains `sys.platform` and
  `win32 on WSL distro path`. A project under `/mnt/c` gets a genuine Windows path and no warning.
  Nothing changes which backend is selected, nor `validate`'s exit code.

- **A multiplexer-detection failure is reported instead of swallowed (#332).** `validate` caught and
  discarded any exception from backend detection, so the selection and the backend inventory
  vanished with nothing said — while the healthy-looking `mux.backend` line above them, which comes
  from an independent call, still printed. It now reports under `mux.backends-detected` at
  **warning**, carrying the error.

- **Provider quota refusals are environment faults on `opencode-http` too (#323).** #194's
  classifier lived on the generic adapter only, so its hookless HTTP sibling silently omitted it: a
  five-hour provider usage limit read as three stalled stories and burned their retry budgets. Both
  adapters now share the classifier, and the `opencode` profile seeds quota, rate-limit and
  connection patterns. Those patterns are scanned against the server's own stdout, never the curated
  transcript carrying the model's words — a pattern is only sound against a log the model cannot
  write to.

- **A re-armed escalation no longer overwrites the previous attempt's dirty snapshot (#349).** The
  preserve-ref names were keyed on the attempt counter, which re-arming resets to 0, so a
  post-resolve re-drive rolling back against the same baseline recomputed the earlier rollback's
  refname and destroyed the only copy of that attempt's work. A free name is now probed for instead,
  suffixing `-r2`, `-r3`, …; the scan is bounded and exhausting it refuses
  (`attempt-worktree-preserve-failed`, then the usual pause) rather than reusing an occupied name.
  Prune the namespace or lower `scm.preserve_keep` if it ever fires.

- **The auto-sweep child refuses config a session rewrote under the run (#461).** `policy.toml` and
  `profiles/*.toml` sit in the agent-writable workspace and reach host code execution — verify
  commands run with a shell, the resolved profile decides the launch argv and env, and
  `[plugins] enabled` gates in-process Python import. A run freezes its policy at launch, but the
  auto-triggered child sweep re-read both from disk; it is now pinned to a launch-time digest of
  those fields and refuses on a mismatch (`sweep-auto-failed` plus a notification, the parent run
  continues), while `resume` re-baselines and warns with the changed categories instead. The digest
  is field-scoped, so live-editing `[limits]` mid-run still works, and plugins are pinned by
  allowlist name only — swapping the module behind an already-enabled plugin is still uncaught
  (#496, #497).

- **The hook relay refuses a redirected `events/` dir, and `validate` stats the relay (#461).** The
  relay's event write followed a symlink — or, on Windows, a directory junction, which needs no
  elevation to create — so a driven session could redirect the orchestrator's control-plane event
  stream and stall the run to `session_timeout_min`. The write now refuses a redirected events dir,
  creates the file privately, and writes the payload in full, degrading to a no-op rather than
  failing the session. Separately, `hooks.registered` never touched the script it points at, so a
  deleted `.bmad-loop/` (a branch switch) read green while every hook event no-opped; a new
  `hooks.relay-present` finding stats the relay and says `run bmad-loop init`.

- **Dispatched sessions are told the sprint board is orchestrator-owned (#437).** The board advances
  at dev-verify time but the story commits only after the review loop, so a session dispatched in
  between opened on an uncommitted, unattributed `sprint-status.yaml` change — one review reverted
  it as a spec violation and #334 escalated a finished story. Story dev prompts, the review prompts
  of sprint and sweep runs, and every injected plugin-workflow session now carry the prohibition:
  never write the board, never revert it, and a row at `done` or `awaiting-operator` is bookkeeping
  rather than a defect to fix. Review prompts alone add the way out (`status: blocked`, for a story
  that cannot be finished without a human decision); stories mode carries none of it.

- **A seed path naming the project root is refused at load, in every source that feeds it (#456).**
  A root-naming entry made worktree provisioning resolve source to the repo root and destination to
  the worktree — both pass its containment checks — so it copied the whole project in, untracked
  files included, then recursed into its own destination. `""` was one spelling of several: `.`,
  `./`, `.\`, and on Windows `". "`, `"..."` and `"   "`, which Win32 trims to the root while
  pathlib reads them as ordinary child names. `scm.worktree_seed`, a profile's `seed_files` and
  `skill_tree`, `hooks.config_path`, a plugin manifest's seeds and its Python module, and the Unity
  seeder's scene guard now refuse every spelling. **Behavior change:** a non-string seed entry is
  rejected rather than silently coerced.

- **`init` no longer follows a config path that leaves the project (#456).** The profile and
  manifest guards are lexical, so a `skill_tree`, `hooks.config_path` or plugin module naming an
  ordinary project-relative directory passed them even when that directory linked out of the tree —
  and unlike worktree provisioning, `init` reached mkdir, rmtree and write with no re-check after
  resolution. Each now requires the target to resolve _strictly below_ the project — equality would
  admit a link back to the root — and a refused skill tree fails the install instead of being
  skipped past `init complete`.

- **A wrongly-typed field in a profile or plugin TOML is reported, not crashed on.** A TOML-legal
  value of the wrong type, an `inf`, or an oversized integer raised past every consumer's error
  handling, so the command died with one `error:` line naming neither the file nor the key. Both
  parsers now funnel at their load boundary, over a fault set closed on the nine value types TOML
  can yield. `policy.toml`'s own conversions are still raw (#474).

- **The worktree git-add shield no longer marks a project's tracked files as ignored (#392).** It
  wrote a pattern for every path it shields, including hook configs and skill trees a project tracks
  — where the pattern shields nothing, since git applies ignore rules only to untracked paths, and
  its one effect was the tracked-and-ignored state repo-hygiene gates reject, blocking the very
  story commit it was meant to protect. Such patterns are now dropped; a tracked **directory** keeps
  its pattern, since that one does hide new children.

- **An isolated codex stage no longer runs without the project's hook config (#471).** The seed list
  and the shield list came from two unreconciled sources, so a profile's hook config was seeded only
  if that profile happened to name the path twice — which claude's `seed_files` does and codex's
  does not. Every non-hookless profile's resolved `config_path` is now seeded.

- **An isolated sweep bundle can land when the deferred-work ledger is gitignored (#426).** A
  worktree checks out tracked files only, so a project that gitignores its ledger — the default —
  gave the unit none, and the bundle deferred on a fixable retry for ever. Provisioning now seeds it
  when the checkout cannot deliver one. A ledger symlinked to an untracked target is seeded to the
  wrong path and still hits this (#462).

- **Every ledger write an isolated unit makes now reaches the main checkout (#425, #458).** A damped
  review round's refiled follow-up and a story's `closes_deferred:` flips died with the unit
  worktree, because the story commit skips the gitignored ledger in silence. Both now re-file after
  the merge, journaled `review-followup-carried` / `review-followup-carry-uncommitted` and
  `story-deferred-close-carried` / `story-deferred-close-carry-uncommitted`.

- **A host lost in the merge-to-carry window replays a carry that filed no findings (#433).** The
  resume pre-pass only replayed units carrying harvested findings, so a unit whose sole ledger
  payload was a bundle's closures, a damped review follow-up or a story's `closes_deferred:` flips
  was skipped and that write stranded. Replay eligibility now names every payload the carry
  delivers, and runs before the sweep reads the open set so a replayed closure leaves it before
  triage re-bundles. An accepted state sync and an accepted repair session replay too.

- **A deferred bundle's closure is no longer carried by the resume replay (#433).** The deferral
  path deliberately re-files the harvest and withholds the closure — a defer discarded the code that
  closure claims to have resolved — but the replay carried it anyway, and since only `open` entries
  are re-bundled a wrongly `done` entry is invisible to every later sweep. The replay now mirrors
  the deferral exactly: harvest only.

- **The ledger snapshot a rollback restores from degrades loudly (#420).** A probe that cannot
  answer whether the ledger is in scope or tracked now keeps the file (`ledger-scope-probe-failed`,
  `ledger-tracked-probe-failed`), and reaching the restore unarmed records `ledger-snapshot-missing`
  instead of passing in silence. The revert is lossless either way: a spec's `deferred:` frontmatter
  is never mutated, so the next attempt re-harvests from it.

- **A worktree missing its required upstream skills now pauses instead of stalling (#433).**
  Provisioning skips a skill tree resolving outside the repo — exactly what a symlink to a shared
  machine-wide BMad install is — while the run-start preflight stats through that symlink and
  passes, so an isolated run was dispatched into a worktree holding none of its skills and every
  session stalled on `Unknown command`. Undelivered paths are journaled `worktree-seed-skipped`, and
  the engine re-probes disk before dispatch. Only the deterministic skill contract can pause a run —
  the resolved dev primitive plus the review skills this project's `customize.toml` requires;
  everything else in the catalogue is copied best-effort and can never pause a run.

- **A wheel-bundled skill that lands partially in a worktree is reported (#464).** A `bmad-loop-*`
  skill the copy could not deliver — a checkout file squatting the skill's directory refuses the
  whole subtree under per-file no-clobber — seeded nothing and said nothing. Shortfalls are now
  re-probed on disk and journaled `worktree-module-skills-dropped`: informational, never a pause,
  because these skills dispatch at the main checkout and their absence in a worktree stalls no
  session.

- **Worktree provisioning survives a filesystem it cannot fully read (#422).** A single unreadable
  file, dangling link, symlink cycle or FIFO in the repo's skill trees or seed sources ended the
  whole run with a traceback where a named, resumable escalation belonged. Every probe and copy the
  isolated seed makes is now total, on one shared walk that descends symlinked source directories
  without looping. Only provisioning degrades.

- **A worktree's hook config is never registered through a symlink (#421).** A checkout carrying its
  per-CLI settings file as a symlink out of the tree had the registration read the _outside_ file
  and write there — mutating the operator's real dotfile while the worktree, left with no Stop hook,
  never reported completion. The whole profile is now refused unless the path is inside the worktree
  with no symlinked component on the way to it.

- **A renderer stub that cannot compose its prompt now fails the preflight (#410).** A stub
  `SKILL.md` (BMAD-METHOD#2601) shells out to a renderer script; when that cannot run it writes
  `HALT: …` and the session stops with no spec — a fact about the install, so every story does the
  same. Three `problem` findings now refuse it up front: `skills.dev-renderer` for a short script
  unit, `skills.dev-renderer-config` for an absent `_bmad/config.toml`, and
  `skills.dev-renderer-sources` for a missing `workflow.md` or snapshot target.

- **Refuse `isolation = "worktree"` combined with a `repo_root` override (#414).** The pair produced
  a green preflight and then an isolated session with no dev primitive, no result, and nothing
  journaled naming the cause. `validate` now reports it; `run`, `sweep`, `resume` and the child
  sweep refuse to start; the dry-run banner names it first; the TUI toasts it ahead of its
  clean-tree gate. Making the two work together is #443.

- **A configured path carrying `[`, `*` or `?` no longer makes git act on the wrong files (#423).**
  `implementation_artifacts` reaches git verbatim out of `_bmad/bmm/config.yaml`, and git reads a
  positional operand as a _pathspec_ — so such a name always matched wider than it named: an
  unrelated sibling was staged under a story's name, a changed attempt reported CLEAN, and a
  rollback's preserve restore handed back a change the reset had just discarded. Every operand is
  now literal.

- **`diagnose` pseudonymizes the spec name, and gives one spec one alias (#433).** A journal
  record's `spec` field carries the customer's feature name, and a bare basename is
  identifier-shaped, so the scrub fallback shipped it verbatim. `spec` now has an alias namespace of
  its own and the value is reduced to its basename first — the producers disagree on shape, so
  without that one spec drew two aliases and an absolute home path landed in the local `--legend`
  file.

- **The upstream `bmad-dev-auto` → `bmad-build-auto` rename no longer breaks a project (#393).** The
  dev primitive is resolved on disk — `bmad-build-auto` preferred, a marker-complete `bmad-dev-auto`
  accepted — so `validate`, `run`, `sweep` and `resume` pass on either era with no `policy.toml`
  edit. `skills.base-shim` refuses the forwarding shim as marker-incomplete: it is a valid slash
  command, and it HALTs an unattended session on its interactive migration gate. A run mixing
  `.claude/skills` and `.agents/skills` at different eras gets the right name per role, resolved
  against the **workspace** so a run resumed into an existing worktree spells the era that worktree
  carries. Mid-upgrade, the orphaned-override warning says to **copy** the legacy
  `_bmad/custom/bmad-dev-auto.toml`, never rename it, and `--dry-run` says on stderr when its
  preview is not runnable.

- **The git-add shield no longer hides new files in your own checkout (#384).** It appended the tool
  files it writes — skill trees, hook config, seeded configs — to `.git/info/exclude`, which is
  shared with the main checkout and every sibling worktree, permanent and unversioned; projects
  legitimately track those paths, so every **new** file under them silently stopped being staged by
  `git add -A`. The shield now writes a private exclude in the worktree's own gitdir, activated by a
  worktree-scoped `core.excludesFile` that dies with `git worktree remove`.
  **Upgrading from 0.9.1 or earlier:** the lines those versions wrote are still there and upgrading
  does not remove them — open the file `git rev-parse --git-path info/exclude` names, delete the
  shield's own lines (typically the skill trees, the hook config, the `/_bmad` family and any
  `[scm] worktree_seed` path), and use `git check-ignore -v <path>` to name whatever is still
  hidden. #384 has the full account of what got written and why.

- **The shield now proves it applies, or skips with a reason (#384).** Storing the worktree-scoped
  config key proved only that the value was stored, and an inherited `!` negation below a copied
  pattern cancelled it — either way the tool files stayed stageable with nothing reported. It now
  asks git which excludes file actually resolves, re-appends past any negation, and honors an
  **explicitly empty** `core.excludesFile` as "no excludes file at all". An unreadable file, an
  unresolvable git home, a peer-accessible `core.sharedRepository` or an unanswerable probe skips
  the shield — journaled, notified.

- **Caveats for the worktree shield (#384).** It enables `extensions.worktreeConfig`, a
  **permanent** repo-format flag; it is rolled back wherever it could be left set without a working
  shield, surviving only where a sibling worktree depends on it or the rollback itself failed — the
  reason says which. It needs **git 2.20**: below that the shield is skipped and no repo-format
  change is made, since git that old refuses a repo carrying the flag. Concurrent runs serialize on
  a `.git` lock.

- **The git-add shield's git calls run on the shared chokepoint (#389).** They were the last bare
  `git` spawns outside it, so they missed its `LC_ALL=C` pin and used a hardcoded 120s timeout
  instead of the configured `[limits] git_timeout_s`. Both now apply.

- **An odd byte in a commit subject no longer crashes the TUI's story checkpoint (#390).** The modal
  read the subject with a strict locale decode, so a commit whose subject is undecodable in the
  run's codec raised mid-render and took the dialog down. It now goes through the git chokepoint and
  decodes with replacement, degrading one label instead; a stalled `git log` surfaces as a missing
  subject in seconds rather than freezing the UI.

- **A non-UTF-8 filename no longer crashes the run past every git guard (#377).** The git chokepoint
  decoded git's output strictly, and the resulting error matched neither its timeout arm nor its
  spawn arm — so it escaped untyped past every `except GitError`: the merge pre-flight, the
  stale-run reconcile at every run and sweep start, and `git diff`, whose failure bypassed the valve
  that preserves a failed unit's work. It is now a `GitError` like any other git failure.

- **One undecodable byte of verify output no longer crashes the run (#378).** Verify commands are
  arbitrary operator tools and their captured output was decoded strictly, so a child emitting bytes
  invalid in the run's encoding lost every command's result instead of classifying the failure.
  Output now decodes with replacement; the tail is display-only, while exit codes still drive
  classification.

- **A short write no longer truncates the worktree exclude (#375).** The update rewrote the file in
  place, so an `ENOSPC` or `EIO` partway through cut the operator's own excludes mid-content while
  the degrade reason still reported nothing written — and the surviving tail parses as valid
  patterns, so nothing reported the damage: cut shield lines simply stop shielding, and a cut
  landing on a path boundary widens a surviving pattern over a whole subtree. The update is now
  atomic — fully applied or untouched.

- **The exclude's git query no longer crashes on a non-UTF-8 repo path (#374).** POSIX filenames are
  bytes, so a repo path carrying bytes invalid in the locale encoding raised out of a
  documented-best-effort helper that caught neither arm of it. Git's output is now captured as bytes
  and decoded with the filesystem codec inside the guarded tail.

- **The worktree's local git exclude is best-effort now (#359).** Only its `git rev-parse` was
  guarded; the filesystem tail crashed the run on a symlink loop, a read-only `.git`, or a non-UTF-8
  exclude file or seed path. It now degrades to a journaled `worktree-exclude-degraded` reason —
  without the exclude, the unit's commit would fold the provisioned skill trees and tool configs
  into the merge. Git unqueryable at all stays a silent, expected skip.

- **A spec left with a blank `status:` is rescued again (#369).** A blank-but-present `status:` read
  as the truthy token `none`, so the prose `## Auto Run Result` fallback never fired and synthesis
  read inconsistent — and since that consistency gates the post-kill rescue (#61), a session that
  lost only its final Stop was discarded as stalled. Blank frontmatter with a prose `blocked` or
  `awaiting-operator` now gets a truthful label too; routing is unchanged.

- **A blank frontmatter `status:` reads as blank, not as the token `none` (#358).** YAML parses a
  bare `status:` line as null, which was then stringified, so every gate saw a token nothing in the
  project writes — and a half-finalized generic spec was read as carrying a deliberate custom status
  and left untouched. A YAML-null status now reads as empty, the same as a missing key, while a
  literal `status: none` stays the string; `confirm` renders `status: (blank)` and the stories-mode
  board reads `present`.

- **Spec writers no longer relay a spec's line endings (#357).** The writers read specs through a
  universal-newline translation that handed each one an all-LF copy of a CRLF spec, so a write meant
  to move one value rewrote every line ending in the file. All four now read bytes and a replaced
  line carries its own terminator, so each line keeps the ending it had; a CR-only spec is a clean
  no-op through the two strippers.

- **A trailing inline comment on a spec's `status:` line survives the write (#357).** The writers
  kept everything through the colon and dropped the rest, so `status: draft  # set by hand` came
  back as `status: done`. The comment and its separating whitespace now carry through whenever a
  conservative token pattern can certify where the scalar ends; anything it cannot read as a bare
  token falls back to the full drop, and the value's own quotes are still dropped deliberately.

- **A spec status the writer cannot rewrite is no longer a silent no-op (#335).** The writer found
  its line by prefix while every reader parses the block as YAML, so a quoted key, a space before
  the colon or a flow mapping wrote nothing and told no one — while a block scalar, a continued
  value or a nested `status:` was rewritten into corruption. The edit is now re-parsed with
  `yaml.safe_load` as an oracle and kept only if the block still parses as a mapping, its `status`
  is the target, and every other key is unchanged.

- **A status no line edit can safely move now raises instead of reporting success (#335).** `False`
  now means "nothing to change", so setting an already-`done` status returns without rewriting,
  while a genuine failure raises: a re-arm aborts before persisting rather than routing the re-drive
  to the wrong step.

- **A symlink-loop fault at park no longer loses the run's park (#335).** Below Python 3.13 a
  symlink loop is reported as a type neither guard on the park path held, and the park-index write
  ran outside every `try` in the commit phase — so an escape skipped the park notification, the
  `post_commit` hook and the state save. Both guards now hold the type, and the writer degrades to
  its `operator-index-failed` journal line.

- **An unwritable `ATTENTION` file can no longer crash a run.** The notice promised "never raises",
  but only its desktop half was guarded — so an unwritable run dir turned an advisory notice into a
  run crash at every site that journals a decision and then announces it: defer, escalate, plugin
  veto, manual-recovery pause, budget warnings. The file sink now degrades like the desktop one; the
  journal entry each caller writes first remains the durable record.

- **`limits.max_tokens_per_story` is validated like its per-session sibling.** It was parsed with a
  bare `int()`, so `true` silently became a 1-token story cap and `0` was accepted, both against the
  documented `int >= 1`. Non-integers and values below 1 now raise `PolicyError` at load. Note this
  rejects a `policy.toml` that previously loaded; there is no `0 = off` semantic — set the cap high
  instead, it only warns.

- **A pause inside a defer's rollback no longer loses the defer record (#342).** The task reached
  terminal DEFERRED before the tree was recovered, so a rollback that paused instead — rollback off,
  the default, or a preserve failure — unwound past the tail for ever: no `story-deferred` journal
  entry, no defer notification, an under-counted `defer_count` in `diagnose`. The record is now
  emitted before the pause re-raises, and its notice points at the ACTION REQUIRED manual-recovery
  notice instead of describing a rollback that never ran.

- **Spawn-level `OSError` is translated at the git chokepoint (#343).** Only a timeout was
  translated, so an `EMFILE`, `ENOMEM` or `ENOENT` out of the spawn itself bypassed every
  OSError-blind `except GitError` guard and crashed the run — under exactly the resource pressure
  those guards exist for. Spawn faults now raise a typed `GitSpawnError` with the errno on
  `__cause__`: a fault opening a unit worktree pauses instead of marching the queue into DEFERRED,
  and one during merge-target reconciliation keeps the unit branch and escalates.

- **`safe_rollback` no longer swallows a failed `git stash create` (#340).** The empty snapshot
  silently disabled the whole `preserve` restore, so the hard reset reverted exactly the paths the
  caller asked to keep — a resolved re-drive's corrected spec — with no error anywhere. It now
  raises before the reset, and only where a restore was actually requested, so the callers that ask
  for none degrade as before.

- **A spawn-level `OSError` during the attempt snapshot no longer crashes the run (#343).** An
  `EMFILE` or `ENOMEM` escaped untyped out of the middle of a rollback. Preservation is observation
  rather than a repair write, so it now degrades into the same journal-and-decide path a `GitError`
  takes, keeping the errno as the breadcrumb; `safe_reset` still raises.

- **A git fault while counting the attempt's commits no longer crashes the rollback (#343).** The
  range above baseline was enumerated with no guard at all, so an ordinary git timeout or a spawn
  fault took the run down mid-rollback. An un-determinable range now reads as "there may be work
  above baseline" and refuses the reset instead of taking the clean-tree early return, journaled
  `attempt-preserve-enumerate-failed` apart from `attempt-preserve-failed`.

- **The orchestrator's ledger writers no longer inject lines from a multiline value (#305).** Found
  by [@Haven2026](https://github.com/Haven2026) in #274. The deferred-work ledger is line-oriented
  but its mutators interpolated their arguments verbatim, so a note could mint a phantom entry,
  truncate an entry's span and re-surface its tail as a phantom legacy item, or leave one entry
  carrying two `status:` lines. Line breaks in free text now collapse to a space — sanitized rather
  than rejected, because a formatting defect must not cost a triage attempt.

- **Ledger writers validate the orchestrator-owned fields (#305).** A non-ISO `date`, a `status`
  outside `open`/`done <date>`, or a `severity` outside `critical|high|medium|low` now raises rather
  than landing in the file. The inner dev session and the sweep's migration session still write
  ledger markdown directly, so the sweep skill now states the single-line expectation — picked up on
  `bmad-loop init --force-skills`.

- **A deferred finding appended after the last ledger entry is no longer lost (#304).** Found and
  first fixed by [@Haven2026](https://github.com/Haven2026) in #274. The inner dev session appends
  each defer as a flat block, which the last canonical `### DW-<n>` entry's span absorbed — so it
  was invisible to the sweep, to `--dry-run` and to the TUI's legacy view. Spans now end at a flat
  block, and `append_entry` writes the documented `location:` field it had been omitting.

- **A sweep's return to your terminal no longer claims a hand-off that never happened (#227).** The
  return answered success unconditionally, discarding the switch's own result, so a failed switch
  plus a failed fallback still journaled the return and sent the sweep unattended. The return option
  is now cleared only on a real return, a failed one left for the parked window's trailer, and the
  two failures report apart: `ATTENDED` (a human is still there) versus `UNREACHABLE` (no client at
  all), which journals `sweep-return-no-client`.

- **`bmad-loop mux` renders a readable table whatever a backend reports as its version (#321).** A
  probe answering with an embedded newline split every row and stranded SELECTED on a line of its
  own; a very long single line broke the table just as thoroughly, since the column widths are sized
  off the widest cell. A backend's reported version is now one bounded line — folded rather than
  truncated, so the tail naming psmux as the answering binary survives, and capped at 80 characters
  — and every consumer applies the same fold defensively, so an out-of-tree backend cannot split a
  row or a message. On a psmux host the folded value **replaces** the previously truncated version
  in `diagnose --json` and in `validate --json`'s `mux.backend` and `mux.backends-detected`
  findings; the field shapes are unchanged.

- **`bmad-loop mux` explains a row that is available but unselectable (#321).** A backend reads
  AVAILABLE because its binary answers here, which is not the same question as whether automatic
  selection can pick it — on Windows `tmux` is psmux's compatibility shim, so the tmux row looks
  like a real tmux install. Gating the column would be wrong, since a forced choice does reach those
  backends, so the listing now carries a `note:` naming them instead. A forced backend is exempt:
  calling it unselectable would contradict the `*` marker one line above.

- **Both mux client verbs now owe effect, not dispatch (#317).** `TerminalMultiplexer.detach_client`
  widens from `None` to `bool`. tmux reads the effect off the exit code; psmux cannot — every arm of
  its verbs exits 0 whether or not a client moved — so it measures the session's attached-client
  count across the call and answers on the drop, degrading to `False` rather than a vacuous `True`
  where that is unobservable. Out-of-tree backends still returning `None` read as "nothing detached"
  — degraded, not broken.

- **Harden the psmux option channel's safety core (#313).** The cleanup sweeps matched any
  `<name>_@<digits>` key, so a hand-written `@theme_@3` died with window `@3`; keys now carry a
  seam-owned marker (`@bmad_project__blw@3`) only a deliberate imitation collides with.
  `kill_window` frees the keys only once a liveness listing proves the kill landed, so a failed kill
  no longer strips a live window's project tag and return key, and a free that fails warns instead
  of leaking silently. **Dev builds only:** a window parked by a pre-marker build reads as untagged
  and its return move stops firing — restart the ctl psmux server after upgrading.

- **Gate the psmux session project tag on transportability (#320).** The session tag rode a control
  line that stores some project paths corrupted at rc 0 — and a corrupted tag never equals the
  caller's again, so the prune skipped that session for ever. The tag now takes the same transport
  gate as the window channel: a refusal warns, frees the key and leaves the option unset, where the
  prune's run-dir fallback takes over (bounded by #419); accepted writes keep the raise-on-failure
  contract.

- **Give psmux a working per-window option channel (#310).** psmux keeps one user-option scope per
  server and answered empty to any per-window read of an `@`-prefixed name, so the control window's
  project tag bled across rows — letting a prune in one project kill another's window — and the
  parked-return option always read empty. Both now use a session-scoped key carrying the window id
  (`@bmad_project__blw@3`); the `switch-client` leg stays inert on builds predating psmux/psmux#483,
  still inert at 3.3.7.

- **Session-qualify the psmux TUI-side window ids (#291).** #254 covered the engine seam but left
  the launcher's surfaces bare, and that process usually runs outside any pane — where a bare `@N`
  resolves through psmux's most-recent-session fallback rather than the session that minted it, so
  the control-window prune could kill another server's identically-numbered window at rc 0. The
  launcher's window ids now carry their session, and `select_window` resolves the id to an index
  first.

- **Verify environment faults are classified per shell, so Windows stops burning attempts (#302).**
  The `{126, 127}` convention is `sh`'s; `cmd` has no equivalent — a missing tool exits `1`, like
  the "tests failed" that should route to repair — so the arm never fired on win32, leaving #130's
  charged-attempt regression live there. It now classifies on rc 9009, `cmd`'s `is not recognized` /
  `access is denied`, and a probe that also catches a file outside `PATHEXT` exiting `0` unrun — a
  pass verify never earned.

- **psmux window ids are now session-qualified (#254).** psmux mints window ids per server, so a
  bare `@N` replayed as a target routed by the caller's own `$TMUX` — from a `bmad-loop-ctl` pane,
  the ctl server rather than the agent's. The log sink then bound to the engine's own window (empty
  run logs), nudges went to the engine's pane, and teardown killed it instead of the agent's. Both
  verbs now emit the session with the id, degrading to the bare id when the session name contains
  `:` (#221); tmux ids are server-global and untouched.

- **A session's read-back could adopt another story's spec (#261).** The generic dev and review
  read-back picked its artifact by mtime from the shared implementation-artifacts directory — which
  under worktree isolation also covers the main checkout's copy — so a foreign spec landing there
  after launch won: a review that produced nothing scored `completed:done`, and a dev leg skipped
  review. Unlike the rest of this family (#127/#160/#224) it failed toward _landing_ unverified
  work.

- **The read-back is pinned to the spec the orchestrator named (#261).** Wherever the dispatched
  prompt names the path — every review leg, dev repair and patch-restore — the read-back takes that
  path and the directory scan is never reached; a sweep bundle's differently-named spec (#161) needs
  no exemption. A bare-story-key re-drive and a dev attempt 1 keep the scan, and the skill's no-spec
  fallback marker is no longer recorded as a story's spec.

- **A dead session with no evidence it ran can no longer be upgraded to `completed` (#261).** A
  read-back artifact is refused unless a turn ended — a `Stop` event specifically — or the pane log
  grew past a small floor; the two are ORed because each has a blind spot. Scoped to the
  shared-directory read-back; a task-scoped result stays authoritative. Applies to the crash path
  too, journaling `readback-refused-no-proof-of-work`.

- **`validate` requires the review skills your dev primitive really invokes (#260).** The preflight
  held every project to a fixed catalog naming a skill no tagged BMAD-METHOD release ships,
  misdiagnosing it as a missing bmm module even where bmm was installed — so `validate`, `run`,
  `resume` and `sweep` all failed on a stock install. The reviewers now come from the installed
  skill itself: its `customize.toml` review layers, else what its review step names inline, with
  overrides merged as BMAD's own resolver does.

- **New `skills.*` findings for a review-layer config (#260).** A configured layer naming a skill
  the tree lacks is a `skills.review-layer-missing` problem instead of passing and then failing on
  every dev run; disabling every layer is `skills.review-layers-empty`, an unreadable override is a
  `skills.customize-unreadable` warning, and a layer gated by a run-time condition is
  `skills.review-layer-unresolved`. `validate` and the run preflight branch on severity, so an
  advisory can no longer abort a run.

- **Isolated worktrees get the review skills that were validated (#260).** Provisioning copies the
  skills the project's own layers name, not just the fixed base catalog, and seeds `_bmad/custom/` —
  whose user override layer the upstream installer gitignores — so the preflight and the worktree
  run no longer resolve different layer sets.

- **`notify.desktop` works on macOS/Windows, and warns when it can't (#231).** The channel was
  `notify-send`-only, so on macOS and Windows it was inert while defaulting to `true` — every "a
  human is needed" path reached no one. It now dispatches natively (`osascript`, a best-effort WinRT
  PowerShell toast, `notify-send`), passing untrusted text through the environment or argv rather
  than a command string. With none available, `validate` warns `notify.desktop-unavailable` and the
  run start prints one.

- **Scrollable modal dialogs (#275).** The decision, escalation, confirm, sweep-options and
  story-checkpoint TUI dialogs now scroll their bodies and dock their action buttons, so the buttons
  stay reachable with long content down to the dialog's minimum frame height. Safety warnings that
  gate an enabled Resume or Re-arm dock with them, and the Resume confirm re-checks engine liveness
  at click time.

- **A finished story whose session omitted its result marker no longer DEFER-drops (#224).** The
  review HALT intermittently finalizes the spec to `status: done` without the terminal
  `## Auto Run Result` block the harvest scan keys on, so every Stop read `no-artifact`, stall
  nudges re-invoked an already-exited workflow (#149), and after `max_review_cycles` the finished,
  verify-passing work was rolled back.

- **The harvest scan synthesizes a result from terminal frontmatter (#224).** It fires once the
  spec's (path, mtime, status) fingerprint holds stable across two resultless Stops, and the
  post-kill reconcile applies it on a single sighting once the window is provably dead. Synthesized
  results carry `synthesized_from_frontmatter` and journal `session-synthesized-from-frontmatter`.

- **Deterministic missing-marker catch and repair (#276).** The #224 fallback was heuristic: a
  review killed after an mtime bump but before its `in-review` flip could score `done` without
  running. The engine now snapshots the spec at review launch and refuses a candidate still hashing
  equal to it (`unmodified-since-launch`), while an observed mid-session status transition proves
  the session ran and outranks that gate, collapsing the two-Stop fingerprint to one sighting.

- **A synthesized result repairs the spec (#276).** The marker the skill owed is written back
  atomically, refused outside the orchestrator-owned roots or where the fresh frontmatter disagrees
  (`spec-marker-repaired`, `spec-marker-repair-failed`, `spec-marker-repair-skipped`). The launch
  `status:` is **never** mutated: it is load-bearing routing input to the upstream skill.

- **`limits.dev_contract_nudge` (default `true`) asks the skill to repair its own omission (#276).**
  On the first pending Stop the dev adapter sends one nudge, once per session
  (`contract-nudge-sent`); set it `false` to rely on harness-side synthesis alone.

## [0.9.1] — 2026-08-02

Compatibility hotfix for the BMad Method's `bmad-dev-auto` → `bmad-build-auto` rename
(BMAD-METHOD#2651, first shipped in bmad-method 6.10.1-next.33) and the two upstream changes
that rode the same window. Both skill eras are supported; the rename itself needs no
`policy.toml` edit.

### Fixed

- **The dev primitive is resolved on disk, so the upstream rename no longer breaks a project
  (#405).** `bmad-build-auto` is preferred and a marker-complete `bmad-dev-auto` accepted, so
  `validate`/`run`/`sweep`/`resume` pass on either era and report which one resolved. A new
  `skills.base-shim` check refuses the forwarding shim, which HALTs an unattended session when a
  legacy `_bmad/custom/bmad-dev-auto*.toml` sits beside it. `[dev] skill` stays `bmad-dev-auto`.

- **Every session prompt spells the resolved primitive (#405).** Dev, review, repair, restore,
  stories dispatch and all three sweep bundle legs hardcoded `/bmad-dev-auto`, which post-rename
  dispatches the shim. The name is now resolved per skill tree, so a run mixing `.claude/skills`
  and `.agents/skills` gets the right one per role, and the fallback marker matches both prefixes.

- **`--dry-run` says when its preview is not runnable (#405).** Dry runs returned before their own
  skill preflight, so a broken install still got a plausible-looking schedule. Preflight failures
  now print to stderr under a "NOT runnable as-is" banner; exit code stays 0 and stdout is
  untouched, since rc 0 means "the preview rendered", not "ready to run".

- **The skills preflight no longer gates a triage-only CLI's skill tree (#405).** Every `skills.*`
  check asks a dev-primitive question, yet the tree list came from all three adapter roles — so a
  `[adapter.triage]` of `gemini` demanded the whole BMad Method module in `.agents/skills`. It is
  now scoped to dev and review; single-CLI and dev/review-split projects are unaffected.

- **A worktree that could not be given its upstream skills now pauses instead of stalling (#405).**
  The containment guard skips a skill tree symlinked to a shared machine-wide install while the
  run-start preflight stats through that symlink and passes, so every isolated session stalled on
  `Unknown command`. Undelivered skills are journaled `worktree-seed-skipped` and the engine
  escalates before dispatch.
  The seed also merges per _file_, and checks each file for containment — a behaviour change.

- **A renderer stub that cannot compose a prompt fails preflight (#405).** Three new checks block
  `validate`/`run`/`sweep`/`resume` when the resolved `SKILL.md` is the renderer stub
  (BMAD-METHOD#2601): `skills.dev-renderer` for an incomplete script unit,
  `skills.dev-renderer-config` for an absent `_bmad/config.toml` (the renderer's only required
  config layer), and `skills.dev-renderer-sources` for a missing `workflow.md` or an unloadable
  `[[bmad-snapshot:…]]` token.

- **A stale customization override is reported, not obeyed (#405).** `skills.customize-legacy` warns
  when an override still sits at `_bmad/custom/bmad-dev-auto[.user].toml`, where it no longer
  applies — the session runs, unstyled.

- **Worktree isolation carries the `_bmad/` config surface (#405).** The renderer-era primitive
  takes the worktree as its project root and hard-fails when that root has no `_bmad/` — there is
  no walk-up — so on a project that gitignores it (most do) every isolated session HALTed with
  nothing written. Provisioning now merge-copies `_bmad/` per file, and a short seed pauses the run
  when the resolved primitive is a renderer stub, naming what is missing.

- **The renderer's `_bmad/render/` output stays out of story commits (#405, #409).** Outside a git
  repo the check stays quiet rather than fabricating an ok (#409). It is never
  seeded into a worktree and is git-excluded inside one, and `init` now gitignores it — the only
  protection under the default `isolation = "none"`. Neither shield helps a path already tracked,
  so a new `git.render-tracked` warning names the one-time `git rm -r --cached _bmad/render`.

- **Worktree provisioning survives a filesystem it cannot fully read (#405).** The `_bmad/` seed
  and its detector both used `rglob`, which does not descend a symlinked _sub_-directory, so a
  symlinked `_bmad/scripts/lib` was under-seeded and reported complete; both now share the skill
  seed's walk. Per-file faults in the walk are skips the gate names, not an exception out of
  provisioning; the eager `worktree_seed`, plugin and hook-config copies still raise.

- **A seed entry the worktree never got is now reported (#405).** The seed loops dropped an entry
  with a bare `continue` when the containment guard refused it, so a config the repo carries as a
  symlink _out_ of itself delivered nothing and said nothing. Drops are journaled as
  `worktree-seed-dropped`, and `worktree-opened` now fires at mount rather than after the gates.

- **Seeding never writes _through_ a symlink (#405).** Both seed loops probed and copied against
  the _resolved_ destination, and `Path.resolve()` is non-strict — so a dangling link reported its
  slot free and the copy landed at the link's target, a path `git add -A` would stage into the
  story branch. `git worktree add` produces exactly that state for a tracked symlink whose target
  is untracked, so it arrives on a project's _first_ story.

- **A hook config is no longer its own alibi (#405).** The drop report probed the destination for
  existence, but the per-CLI hook step writes `profile.hooks.config_path` after both seed loops, so
  a dropped config was answered for by the hook's own bytes — and for gemini, copilot and
  antigravity that path is the profile's only default seed. Those rels are now asked whether the
  source escapes the repo, or the destination is a symlink or escapes the worktree.

- **`isolation = "worktree"` is refused when `repo_root` is overridden (#405).** A project whose
  `_bmad/bmm/config.yaml` sets `repo_root` — the documented monorepo knob — decouples the git root
  from the project dir. Provisioning seeds every surface off `repo_root` while `init`, `validate`
  and the run preflight write and probe them under `project`, so the preflight approved a surface
  the isolated run never received and every story ended as a result-less Stop.

- **The `repo_root` refusal covers every entry point (#405).** `validate` reports
  `policy.isolation-repo-root`, and `run`, `sweep`, `resume`, `resolve` and the child sweep all
  refuse — drop the override, or set `isolation = "none"`. The child raises rather than declining
  quietly, so a mid-run flip is journaled `sweep-auto-failed`. Plumbing `project` through
  provisioning stays open as #414 and #443.

- **`worktree_clean` and `path_tracked` no longer read their answer out of git's stderr (#405).**
  `ls-files` and `status` exit 0 while still writing to stderr, and that chatter was
  indistinguishable from an index entry or a porcelain line — so `git.render-tracked` named an
  uncommitted path and a clean checkout read dirty. Other callers still merge, which is #442.

- **An undecodable `policy.toml` or `config.yaml` is reported, not a traceback (#405).**
  `UnicodeDecodeError` is a `ValueError`, not an `OSError`, so it escaped every
  `except (PolicyError, OSError)` handler — the TUI could not open and the CLI died at startup on a
  raw codec message naming no file. Both loaders now raise typed errors; `validate` names the file.

- **Deferred review findings are harvested out of the spec's frontmatter (#405).** BMAD-METHOD#2640
  moved `defer`-triaged findings from `deferred-work.md` into the spec's own `deferred:` list,
  silently starving the sweep pipeline. A successful dev, repair or review session now files each
  into the ledger with its `location` and `severity` (`spec-deferrals-harvested`), deduped on a
  fingerprint of its summary and location; the frontmatter is never rewritten, so a revert is
  lossless. The review prompt no longer files the finding itself, which double-filed it.

- **A transient harvest read cannot silently drop recorded findings (#405).** An unreadable,
  missing, undecodable or temporarily malformed spec at the harvest step now follows the existing
  bounded retry paths instead of letting a later verifier accept and commit without the ledger
  repair. A persistent fault defers with the artifacts preserved, or re-escalates a CRITICAL.

- **Post-session ledger work keeps its proof attribution across crash replay (#405).** The
  completed-session checkpoint is refreshed after hooks return, so a retained retry cannot hide a
  hook-authored ledger repair behind an earlier harvest's engine-written exclusion. A pre-feature
  checkpoint with no ledger digest reconstructs attribution from its Git baseline, so a
  ledger-only session still resumes while the new harvest stays excluded from proof.

- **A harvested deferral is reverted when its attempt rolls back (#405).** The harvest runs above
  the artifact gate, so a session that finalized its spec and then failed a non-fixable check left
  an entry describing discarded code the reset cannot remove — the ledger sits under a
  `keep`-shielded artifacts folder. The dev phase now snapshots it and restores around the rollback,
  persisting the snapshot with the attempt and never unlinking a ledger git tracks.

- **That restore spans the whole retry chain (#405).** On the `rollback_on_failure = off` default it
  reverts every attempt's ledger writes, not just the last — matching the
  `git reset --hard <baseline_commit>` the pause notice tells the operator to run. Reaching the
  restore unarmed still records `ledger-snapshot-missing`.

- **The pre-harvest snapshot is spent by a stop-and-wait pause, and scoped to the retry chain
  (#405).** Under the default `rollback_on_failure = off` the operator may append to the ledger
  before typing `resume`, but the armed snapshot survived that wait and the resume wrote stale
  bytes over their edit; the pause leg now disarms as it restores. A fixable retry neither re-arms
  nor spends it, so the revert reaches as far as the reset does. Not closed: `_finish_inflight`'s
  restart arm resets to the same baseline with no ledger restore at all.

- **A harvest is reverted even when the ledger lives outside the repo (#405).**
  `implementation_artifacts` may be configured out of tree, and the restore classified any such
  ledger as git's — backwards, since `reset --hard` cannot reach outside the workspace, so every
  revert was a no-op and the entry outlived the code it described. It now reads as "not git's".

- **The harvest's own ledger write is no longer the session's proof of work, and the session's own
  edit still is (#405).** The dev artifact gate deliberately does not exclude the ledger — a story
  whose whole scope is ledger reconciliation has to count as real work — so it could not tell the
  orchestrator's write from the session's, and a session that changed no code but recorded one
  finding proceeded to done on the engine's line. The gate now excludes the harvest's own attempts,
  and stands down again when the ledger had already moved off the dev phase's baseline.

- **Both of those answers span a fixable retry (#405).** A fixable retry keeps the harvest's ledger
  line with its tree by design, so the repair session met a stale baseline: an attempt that merely
  reverted the offending change passed on the orchestrator's own write, and a stalled attempt
  deferred with an empty record of the harvest's intent. Both records now survive the continuation,
  and the ledger baseline re-bases: forward onto the kept tree, back onto the restored snapshot on a
  rollback. (A gitignored ledger is invisible to the gate either way.)

- **A sweep bundle's ledger closes are withheld until its attempt is accepted (#405).** The
  orchestrator marked a bundle's ids `done` above the artifact gate, so a discarded attempt left the
  ledger claiming its work resolved, and `open_ids` re-bundles only open entries. The close now runs
  below the gate, for a PROCEED decision only. One deliberate consequence: a bundle session that
  changed no code now fails the gate rather than passing on the orchestrator's own bookkeeping.

- **A review-leg defer takes those closes back (#405).** A defer after acceptance — every route, the
  stock `trigger = "recommended"` included — re-opens the ids it closed itself, since `_defer`
  writes its post-close snapshot over the reset that reverted them.

- **An isolated unit's ledger writes reach the main checkout — findings and bundle closes alike
  (#405).** A defer drops the unit worktree unmerged, and a landing unit's ledger edit rides the
  branch only when the ledger is tracked: `finalize_commit` stages with `git add -A`, which skips a
  gitignored path in silence. Both legs now re-file what the harvest intended and re-apply what the
  close **intended**, the DONE leg **after** the merge so entries dedup; `mark_done` is idempotent
  and a DEFER carries findings only. An _unseeded_ gitignored ledger still defers rather than lands.

- **A carry lost to a crash mid-landing replays on resume (#405).** `Phase.DONE` is persisted
  before the merge, the merge removes the worktree, and only then does the carry fire — so a host
  death there skipped it and resume never looked again. Resume now re-runs an unlatched carry once,
  behind a persisted latch and a durable `unit-merged` record; the merge writes its intent before
  invoking git, so an interrupted merge is re-run rather than assumed to have landed.

- **Tracked ledger carry failures stop and remain replayable (#405).** A rejected `git add`,
  `status` or `commit` used to be journaled and swallowed, letting an isolated unit finish with a
  dirty or staged main ledger. A committable carry now persists its commit intent and raises, and
  resume retries it. Gitignored and external ledgers keep their advisory degrade behavior.

- **An artifacts dir whose name holds `[` or `]` no longer misdirects those two paths (#405,
  #423).** Git reads a positional operand as a pathspec, so such a path was a glob that also
  matched its neighbours: the harvest revert's tracked-probe answered off a neighbour and skipped
  its unlink, and the carry's commit swept a neighbour's edit in. Both now name the path literally.

- **Three small contracts brought back into line (#405).** A ledger entry filed with no file:line
  carries `location: n/a`, the value `deferred-work-format.md` has always specified — entries
  already on disk without the line stay valid, so read an absent `location:` as `n/a`. A plugin
  workflow's completion marker resolves on its own role's skill tree, not always the dev one. And
  `diagnose` pseudonymizes the `spec` journal field, which was shipping the feature name verbatim.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-07-21

### Added

- **Active agent indicator (#153).** The TUI run header and tasks table now name who is driving —
  the resolved adapter·model for the live stage, or the run's configured adapters when no session is
  open. Session-start journal entries and session records stamp the resolved adapter identity, and
  `bmad-loop status --json` gains an additive run-level `adapters` (the snapshot-resolved
  dev/review/triage identity, `null` on a run predating stamping) and per-story `adapters_used` (the
  identity actually recorded per role) — both are a projection of the run's persisted policy snapshot
  (re-stamped from current config on resume) and its recorded sessions, not live policy read at status
  time; a run whose snapshot predates adapter stamping reports `adapters: null` rather than a
  fabricated default. Schema version unchanged.

- **Graceful stop (`stop --graceful`, TUI `S`).** Ask a live run to finish its in-flight item —
  a story or sweep bundle through commit, or an in-progress sweep triage — then finalize cleanly
  and stop as a resumable `stopped` run, instead of the hard SIGTERM stop that kills mid-item.
  Delivered through a `stop-request.json` control file consumed at the next item boundary, so it
  needs no signal and works on every platform and multiplexer backend. Pending auto-sweeps are
  suppressed; `--cancel-graceful` withdraws a request, and a hard stop still wins over a pending one.
  `status --json` gains an additive `graceful_stop_pending` field (schema version unchanged).

- **`bmad-loop validate --json` (#205).** A stable, schema-versioned JSON document of the
  preflight: the `ok` verdict, the queue `mode`/`spec_folder`, per-severity `counts`, and every
  check as a flat emission-ordered finding. Each finding carries a **stable `check` id** —
  `hooks.registered`, `adapter.binary`, `skills.base-incomplete`, … — so CI can branch on a
  particular failing gate instead of matching remediation prose, which is the part most likely
  to be reworded. `detail` keeps what each check knew before it flattened itself into a
  sentence: `mux.backends-detected` keeps every detected backend row rather than the text's
  `tmux*, psmux (unavailable)` soup, whose trailing `*` a consumer had to parse to learn which
  backend was selected, and `skills.base-incomplete` keeps `missing_markers` as a list rather
  than a `", "`-joined string. **A failing check emits the whole document and still exits 1** —
  the nonzero code is the verdict being reported, not a failure to produce one, so the existing
  `bmad-loop validate || exit 1` in CI is untouched. `machine.py` gains the clause that makes
  this well-defined: parse non-empty stdout whatever the exit code, and read the verdict from
  the document's own `ok`, which unlike `rc` separates "the checks failed" from "the command
  broke". The text output is byte-for-byte unchanged.

- **`bmad-loop clean --json` / `bmad-loop cleanup --json` (#204).** Stable, schema-versioned
  JSON documents (one per command — they are separate contracts) reporting what a reclaim
  removed, or under `--dry-run` would remove: for `clean` the worktree paths, trimmed,
  archived, deleted and protected run ids, the effective retention policy, and `freed_bytes`
  as a raw integer — the text's `~1.2MB` is a rendering of that number, and formatting is the
  renderer's job; for `cleanup` the run ids whose sessions went, the live ids left alone, and
  the ctl windows closed. Plan and outcome share one schema — same fields, same meanings, with
  `dry_run` saying which one you are holding — so a script can pre-flight and then compare
  against what actually happened. The values are each invocation's own sample rather than a
  promise the two agree: `freed_bytes` is re-measured, and the world can move between the
  preview and the commit. **The real paths are now scriptable at all** — they previously discarded
  the per-item data and printed only a summary line, and `protected` was a bare count. Both
  commands printed progress as they mutated, and both warned mid-loop about an unverifiable
  engine pid; under `--json` that warning becomes a document field, so stderr stays empty and
  stdout stays one pure document.

- **`bmad-loop decisions --json` (#203).** A stable, schema-versioned JSON document of the
  pending deferred-work decisions, so a script can select an option by policy and pre-answer
  it rather than scraping the numbered text. It is strictly richer than that text, which drops
  each decision's `context` and shows only key/label/effect per option — hiding the `intent`,
  `resolution` and `bundle_name` that decide what the next sweep actually builds or writes.
  The recommendation, a `(recommended)` suffix on a free-text line in the text form, becomes a
  derived boolean on the option it names. `--json` implies the listing and never prompts (the
  interactive prompter reads stdin and cannot coexist with a pure document), and nothing
  pending is a valid empty document with exit 0.

- **`bmad-loop list --json` (#192).** A stable, schema-versioned JSON document — one entry
  per run, oldest first (short ref, run id, type, started-at, liveness-aware status, paused
  stage) — replaces the text table when passed. Unparseable runs are included as status
  `unknown`, and an empty runs dir yields a valid empty document with exit 0.

- **`bmad-loop status --json` (#190).** A stable, schema-versioned JSON document (run
  id/type/source, derived status + pause fields, snapshot `cache_read_weight`, raw +
  weighted token totals, and per-story phase/attempt/review-cycle/tokens/commit/defer
  reason) replaces the text output when passed. This is the supported machine-readable
  surface — the human text, whose layout #129 already changed once with no warning
  path, is now explicitly best-effort.

- **`session-end` journal entries carry `tokens_weighted` beside `tokens` (#129).** Only the
  raw scalar was persisted, and the weight cannot be backed out of it, so a session's
  cost-weighted spend was unreconstructible after the fact — the weighted figure existed
  only for sessions that tripped the budget guard. Every entry whose usage was read now
  records both. `null` (never `0`) when the usage read failed, since untracked is not free;
  both fields stay absent on an `aborted` end, where no read happened. Distinct from a
  tripped session's `budget_weighted`, which is the guard's mid-session sample at trip time
  rather than the end-of-session total. The `cache_read_weight` knob also gained a
  description in the TUI settings screen, where it had none.

- **Mid-session token-budget guard (#158).** Both adapter wait loops now sample cumulative
  weighted usage every ~30s and act on crossing the new per-session cap
  (`limits.max_tokens_per_session`, default 4M weighted) per `limits.session_budget_mode`:
  `warn` = one ATTENTION + lifecycle breadcrumb; `enforce` = wrap-up nudge +
  `limits.session_budget_grace_s` (default 240s) to finish, then termination with the new
  `over_budget` session status, which rides the ordinary retry→defer routing. Defaults to
  `warn`: on upgrade, existing installs gain visibility (one ATTENTION line per over-cap
  session) but no terminations — set `session_budget_mode = "enforce"` to opt into the
  hard bound, or `"off"` to silence the guard entirely. Session-end
  journal entries carry `budget_weighted`/`budget`/`budget_mode` for tripped sessions.
  Live-verified on `claude`; other transcript-reading profiles sample best-effort, and
  adapters with no mid-session usage signal (`usage_parser = "none"`, Copilot) stay inert.

- **OpenCode adapter (`opencode-http` profile, alias `opencode`).** Drives
  [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) ≥ 1.18 entirely over HTTP/SSE — one headless
  `opencode serve` per session (no tmux window), SSE `session.idle` as the completion
  signal with an HTTP poll fallback, per-session server password, hermetic skills, and
  token usage read back over the API. Full dev/review synthesis parity via the new
  `_ResultFileMixin`/`_DevSynthesisMixin` seams in `generic.py`; profiles gained a
  hookless `[hooks] dialect = "none"` mode (no hook registration anywhere). Install the
  HTTP client with `pip install 'bmad-loop[opencode]'`; set `model` as `provider/model`.
  The pinned 1.18.2 API contract is recorded in the adapter's module docstring, guarded
  by a zero-token real-binary smoke test (`tests/test_opencode_live.py`, skipped when
  the binary is absent).

- **Native-Windows `psmux` multiplexer backend (experimental).** A bundled builtin that
  drives runs on native Windows through psmux — a ConPTY tmux re-implementation that speaks
  the tmux CLI via its own `psmux` binary — so tmux's session/window model and the
  `bmad-loop-<run-id>`/`bmad-loop-ctl` session names carry over unchanged. It registers for
  `win32` and is the platform default there, selected automatically when the `psmux` and
  `pwsh` binaries are on `PATH` and psmux reports newer than 3.3.6 (older releases can
  force-kill a recycled PID during teardown, so they read as unavailable and selection falls
  through). Native Windows stays experimental — window hosting, attach/detach mapping, and
  Unity cache-path correctness are tracked in the roadmap — but the dev→review→verify→commit
  loop and TUI observation run. WSL is unaffected (it _is_ Linux and uses tmux). (#58)

- **Out-of-tree multiplexer backends (`bmad_loop.mux_backends` entry points).** A backend
  package installed next to bmad-loop (e.g. `uv tool install bmad-loop --with <adapter>`) now
  registers itself with no config step: before every selection, core imports each module
  advertised under the `bmad_loop.mux_backends` entry-point group, whose import-time
  `register_multiplexer(...)` call makes the backend selectable exactly like a bundled one
  (builtins load first, so default selection is unchanged by installing an adapter). A package
  that fails to import can never break selection — the failure is recorded and surfaced as a
  `warning:` line by `bmad-loop mux` and a note in the `validate` preflight
  (`external_backend_errors()`).

- **Unity modal-dialog guards (`[plugins.unity]`).** A chronically-dirty Unity scene raises modal
  Editor dialogs ("scene changed on disk", "save changes before closing") that freeze the MCP
  dispatch loop and stall the whole run. The bundled Unity plugin now defends in depth: it seeds an
  editor-only `SceneAutoSaveGuard` into the project (`install_scene_guard`, default on), quiesces
  the Editor around a failed-attempt rollback so `git reset --hard` can't leave a stale scene open
  (`quiesce_on_rollback`, default on), and appends the scene-save discipline (from a shipped
  `unity_facts.md`) to every dev/review prompt so the agent saves at the boundaries that would
  otherwise trip a modal. As a last-resort observability net, an opt-in **detect-only** probe
  (`dialog_probe`, default off) watches — via xdotool, X11/Linux only — for those dialogs and
  _reports_ any it sees (a JSONL record, an `ATTENTION` line, and a best-effort `notify-send`); it
  never clicks or keys anything, no-ops where there is no X display, and self-reaps when the engine
  exits (`dialog_probe_interval_sec`, `dialog_probe_notify`).

- **Follow-up-review damping (`limits.max_followup_reviews`, default 1).** Bounds how many extra
  review rounds a story is granted _solely_ because a completed round finalized `status: done` yet
  still set `followup_review_recommended: true`. Once spent, the next such round force-converges —
  verify, then re-file the lingering recommendation to the deferred-work ledger, then commit —
  instead of burning cycles up to `max_review_cycles`. This damps the structurally non-convergent
  case where every review pass patches findings and therefore recommends another pass. The damped
  converge is the expected steady state and stays quiet (no ATTENTION); only the re-review cap (a
  story that itself originated from a `review-budget-followup` entry and still won't converge) still
  notifies. Verify-repair rounds, non-terminal rounds, and `PAUSE`/`DEFER`/`RETRY` never spend the
  grant; `0` never honors a pass's own recommendation. `runs.rearm_escalation` resets the counter so
  a human-resolved re-drive gets a fresh budget.

- **Resizable dashboard panes.** Every pane boundary is now adjustable by mouse-drag (divider
  bars, which also carry the Sprint / Deferred Work headings) or a keyboard resize mode (`ctrl+w`,
  then `←`/`→` for the sidebar, `↑`/`↓` for the active horizontal split, `Tab` to pick it, `Esc` to
  exit). Sizes persist per-project to a new `[tui]` section in `policy.toml` and re-apply on the
  next launch; untouched projects keep the previous fixed proportions.

- **Dev-choosable multiplexer backend selection (#87).** `get_multiplexer()` now resolves by
  precedence — `BMAD_LOOP_MUX_BACKEND` env var → the new machine-scoped `[mux] backend` key in
  policy.toml → the platform default (win32: `psmux`, elsewhere: `tmux`) when installed → the first
  registered backend that matches the platform _and_ is `available()` — so two same-platform
  backends (psmux / tmux-windows) no longer collide by registration order. Forced names are trusted
  (no availability gate) and fail loudly when unregistered, naming the policy file. New
  `bmad-loop mux` lists registered backends (platform / available / version / selected + why);
  `bmad-loop mux set <name>` persists the choice (`--clear` reverts to auto, `--force` allows a
  name that only registers on the target machine); no interactive prompts anywhere. `validate`'s
  preflight lists all detected backends when more than one is registered and notes an env/policy
  forced selection. A tmux-less POSIX host still selects `TmuxMultiplexer` and reports it
  unavailable, exactly as before.

- **Seam-canonical window targets.** The `=session[:window]` target grammar is now owned by the
  `TerminalMultiplexer` seam instead of living as hand-assembled tmux syntax in core: a new
  concrete `target(session, window=None)` encoder (overridable per backend, tmux inherits the
  default and passes it straight through) and a module-level `parse_target()` decoder that
  native-id backends reuse instead of re-deriving the grammar (the out-of-tree herdr
  adapter's `_parse_target` delegates to it). `runs.py`/`tui/launch.py`/`tui/app.py` format every
  target via `target()` (new `runs.session_target` / `launch.ctl_target` helpers) — output is
  byte-identical, so no backend or operator behavior changes; the contract is documented in the
  adapter authoring guide's new "Window targets" section.
- **Herdr multiplexer backend — shipped out-of-tree.** A complete non-tmux-family
  `TerminalMultiplexer` backend for [herdr](https://herdr.dev)'s cross-platform
  workspace/tab/pane model was developed in-tree (engine run path #136, TUI-launch surface
  #137) and extracted before ever shipping in a release to
  [`bmad-loop-adapter-herdr`](https://github.com/pbean/bmad-loop-adapter-herdr), where it
  co-installs with bmad-loop and registers through the `bmad_loop.mux_backends` entry-point
  discovery above. Core bundles only tmux; herdr's capabilities, remaining degradations, and
  operator notes live in the adapter repo's docs.
- **Stories mode — a second planning pipeline that drives the loop off a typed `stories.yaml` (folder+id dispatch) instead of `sprint-status.yaml`.** Opt in with `[stories] source = "stories"` + `spec_folder`, or per run with `bmad-loop run --spec <folder>` (overrides policy); `--story` then filters by story id. Each entry dispatches by folder + id — the dev skill creates-or-resumes the story spec at `<folder>/stories/<id>-<slug>.md` and the orchestrator reads that id-keyed path back deterministically (no shared board to line-edit, no result-artifact mtime-scan). Strictly linear schedule (list order, no `depends_on`); `bmad-loop run --dry-run --spec <folder>` and `bmad-loop status` print the board (id · live disk state · checkpoint markers · title). Sprint mode is unchanged and remains the default. Requires a `bmad-dev-auto` new enough for folder+id dispatch — the run preflight checks and remediates.
- **Per-story human checkpoints (stories mode).** Independent `spec_checkpoint` (pause before code to review the plan — dev halts at `ready-for-dev`; approve to implement, or request a replan that resets the spec to `draft`) and `done_checkpoint` (pause after the story commits, skipped when it is the last story); both additive to `gates.mode`. A blocked story escalates + resolves as in sprint mode, with a pre-planning-halt sentinel auto-deleted (a copy preserved under the run dir) on re-arm.
- **TUI human-in-the-loop surface for stories mode.** The sprint tree is replaced by a stories board (id · live disk state · spec/done checkpoint markers · title) when a stories-mode run is selected; paused runs carry a per-run pause-kind badge and the run list shows a global _⚑ N need attention_ count; `p` opens the stage-appropriate viewer — plan-checkpoint spec review (Approve & resume / Request replan), story-checkpoint summary card (Continue / Stop), escalation with story context (Resolve / Re-arm & resume), and a gate spec viewer that the existing spec-approval/epic pauses reuse. The start-run modal gains a source select + spec-folder field with a live schedule preview. Every TUI action calls the same code paths as the CLI.
- **Intent-gap patch-restore recovery.** When review halts on an `intent gap`, `bmad-dev-auto`
  now saves the attempted change as a patch before reverting (BMAD-METHOD#2564). If the attempted
  reading was correct, `bmad-loop resolve` re-arms the spec to `in-review` and re-applies the patch
  onto baseline after every reset, so the re-driven session resumes review on the restored diff
  instead of re-implementing. New `--restore-patch <path>` flag for the `--no-interactive` path; a
  patch that fails to apply escalates instead of running on a half-restored tree (a resolve session
  that committed over the patched lines triggers exactly this — re-resolve without a restore).
  Restore is rejected up front for worktree-isolation runs and for stories-mode pre-planning
  sentinels, and the latched patch file itself never counts as proof-of-work. Deferred-work
  `sweep` bundles get the same recovery — an escalated bundle re-arms to `in-review` and the
  re-driven bundle session resumes review on the re-applied patch (#75).
- **Preflight covers the inline review layers.** `bmad-loop validate` (and run-start) now require the
  three upstream review-hunter skills `bmad-dev-auto`'s step-04 invokes — `bmad-review-adversarial-general`,
  `bmad-review-edge-case-hunter`, and `bmad-review-verification-gap` (new in BMAD-METHOD#2550) — plus a
  `customize.toml` in `bmad-dev-auto` (its review-layer config, BMAD-METHOD#2535/#2550). A pre-July bmm
  install missing any is reported with remediation before a run stalls.

### Changed

- **The TUI's validate modal (`v`) renders `validate --json` instead of the text output (#210).**
  One row per check — glyph, stable `check` id, message — with the verdict taken from the
  document's `ok` rather than the exit code, which cannot tell "the checks failed" from "the
  command broke". A check's `detail` is now reachable at all: inline for warnings and problems,
  and `d` toggles it on for everything, so `mux.backends-detected` expands to a row per backend
  instead of the text's `tmux*, psmux (unavailable)`. A failure adds a footer noting the gates
  are chained — the later gates emit nothing after one fails, so a short list is not a short
  list of problems. An unrenderable document (a newer schema, unparseable stdout) re-runs
  validate in text mode and shows the old modal unchanged.

- **`validate` reports a failed external mux backend as a warning, not a note (#210).** The
  `mux.external-backend` finding has always read as a failure — "external mux backend 'x'
  failed to load: …" — while carrying severity `ok`, so it counted as a passing check; it is
  now `warning`, matching what `bmad-loop mux` has always printed for the same condition. It
  stays below `problem` deliberately: selection degrades past a broken external, so the verdict
  and exit code are unchanged. On an affected host `validate --json`'s `counts` shift by one
  (`warning` +1, `ok` −1) while `ok` and rc do not; the schema version is deliberately
  unchanged, since the document contracts each `check` id, not a given check's outcome. The
  text line gains the doubled `ok:   warning:` prefix that `render()` preserves by design.

- **BREAKING: `probe-adapter` now runs `diagnose`'s egress leak self-check, and captured hook
  payloads ship as a schema instead of scrubbed values (#199).** The rendered report re-scans
  itself before emitting (the guard moved to `sanitize.guard`, one audited implementation for
  both commands): an email / secret / home path / username in the final bytes makes the command
  refuse to emit — message on stderr, empty stdout, exit ≠ 0, no `--out` file — and a stray
  occurrence of the pseudonymized project directory name is repaired to its alias and disclosed.
  Each captured event now reports dotted key paths with leaf types (`tool_input.command:str`),
  never payload values, so the `--json` document's `schema_version` bumps to 2
  (`captured_events[].payload` removed, `payload_schema` added; `payload_keys` stays, now
  identifier-gated). Collection hardening rides along: transcript-location components that embed
  the username are redacted, the project dir name is aliased in locations, a home-rooted
  `--binary` hint renders `~`-relative, and a credential-shaped dict key can no longer surface
  in the token key paths.
- **BREAKING: `diagnose --json` and `probe-adapter --json` now emit a pure JSON document
  (#195).** Both used to print their human-readable report with a fenced ` ```json ` block
  appended, so a consumer had to scrape the fence out of prose. `--json` now emits the
  document _instead of_ the report — stdout parses whole, and every human-facing line (`ok:`
  trailers, the leak-backstop warning, the `unknown profile` notice) moves to stderr. With
  `--out FILE` the document goes to the file, stdout stays empty and the confirmation goes to
  stderr; **no file written in JSON mode carries markdown fences any more**. That file is held to
  the same standard as the stream — it is validated and newline-terminated identically, so
  `--json --out FILE` and `--json > FILE` produce byte-identical files. The text mode (no
  `--json`) is unchanged. `diagnostics.SCHEMA_VERSION` deliberately stays at 1 — it versions the
  document, and only the packaging changed — while the probe document gains a `schema_version`
  of 1 alongside its existing `version` key, which still holds the _probed CLI's_ `--version`
  output. Scripts that split on ` ```json ` must switch to parsing stdout directly; the break is
  in the flag's output shape, not in either payload. Two
  incidental fixes ride along: `diagnose --json` no longer renders the markdown report it was
  about to discard, which was double-counting every leak-backstop repair in the warning, and
  the probe document is now `sort_keys`-stable so two probes of the same CLI diff cleanly.
- **Machine-output (`--json`) contract codified in `machine.py`.** The pure-document conventions
  from #190 — one JSON object on stdout, inline `schema_version`, additive-only evolution,
  errors → stderr with empty stdout — now live in one module with shared `emit`/`add_json_flag`
  helpers; `status --json` uses them (output byte-identical) and the duplicated token-total math
  folded into `run_token_totals`. All four `--json` commands share the contract (#195); `--json`
  adoption on more commands is tracked in #196.
- **Backend-neutral naming for the seam-backed helpers and operator messages.** The multiplexer
  seam has non-tmux backends now, so the helpers that wrap it drop their legacy tmux names —
  `launch.tmux_available` → `mux_available`, `app._tmux_missing` → `_mux_missing`,
  `runs.tmux_sessions` → `mux_sessions` (internal, no deprecation aliases) — and the operator-facing
  strings stop naming tmux when they mean the selected backend: launch errors say
  `multiplexer new-session/new-window failed` and `multiplexer backend unavailable (binary not on
PATH)`, the TUI notifies `multiplexer backend unavailable — launch/attach disabled` and
  `launched (control session bmad-loop-ctl)`, and the "attach to … bmad-loop-ctl" hints say
  _control session_. The TUI-guide troubleshooting table matches. Behavior is unchanged.
- **Docs: multiplexer backend guide (`docs/multiplexer-backends.md`).** The user-facing docs no
  longer claim tmux is the only multiplexer backend. The new page covers backend selection
  (`bmad-loop mux` / `mux set`) and how external backends are installed and discovered;
  backend-specific operator guidance (what changes from your seat on herdr, its degradations)
  moved out with the extraction and lives in each adapter repo's docs. README, setup guide,
  TUI guide, and FEATURES name the mechanism and link the page.
- **Docs: `followup_review_recommended` is now scored upstream.** BMAD-METHOD#2580 replaced the
  skill's convergence-prone significance judgment with a severity-weighted score over patched
  findings and added a fourth default review layer (Intent Alignment Auditor, #2560). README,
  FEATURES, TUI guide, the `[review].enabled` setting description, and the engine's damping
  comments now describe the scored flag; `limits.max_followup_reviews` is unchanged and remains
  the orchestrator-side bound.
- **`bmad-loop init` now gitignores `.bmad-loop/policy.toml`.** Policy is per-machine-per-repo —
  it carries the machine-specific `[mux] backend` choice (and the TUI settings editor rewrites
  it), so it must not travel to teammates on other machines or OSes. A `.gitignore` entry does not
  untrack an already-committed file: existing repos run `git rm --cached .bmad-loop/policy.toml`
  once (the local copy is kept; `init` prints this hint when it detects a tracked policy).
  bmad-loop's own worktree-clean preflight already exempted policy.toml — this additionally stops
  inner dev sessions and plain `git status` from reading a policy edit as a dirty tree.
- **The patch-restore seam is now one validator, one path normalizer, and one exclusion site.**
  `runs.validate_restore_latch` holds every latch precondition (sentinel wedge, spec-less escalation,
  worktree isolation) — the worktree check lived only in the CLI, so `rearm_escalation` called
  programmatically could latch a patch the re-drive can never honor; it now rejects it too.
  `verify.resolve_restore_path` replaces four copies of the maybe-relative→absolute join, and the
  shared verify gate derives the restore-patch proof-of-work exclusion from the task instead of
  threading it in from three call sites. The resolve context's `restore_supported` signal is now the
  validator's verdict too, so the agent never negotiates a restore for a sentinel-wedged or spec-less
  escalation either. Otherwise behavior-neutral. (closes #91)
- **Test helper fidelity.** `make_engine` seeds the launching scope (`max_stories`, `story_filter`,
  `epic_filter`) on `RunState` like `cmd_run` does, so resume tests no longer silently ran uncapped;
  the three `_escalated_run` fixtures collapse into one parameterized conftest builder. (closes #84)

### Fixed

- **Locale-stable rollback (#236).** Git subprocesses now run with `LC_ALL=C`, so `safe_rollback`'s
  benign "pathspec did not match" no-op is no longer misread as a hard failure under a localized git
  (e.g. `LANG=it_IT.UTF-8`) — which had turned a resolvable re-drive into a rollback pause. Forced at
  the single `_run_git` spawn point, so every git message the orchestrator inspects stays English.

- **The parked-window return target is now backend-composed (#221).** An interactive attach
  recorded the client's origin as a bare pane id (`%N`) and replayed it as `switch-client -t %N`
  from inside the control session — sound under tmux's one-server model, but on psmux (one
  server per session, upstream-final per psmux/psmux#483) a bare id is session-local: at best
  unresolvable, at worst colliding with a real control-session pane and landing the client on
  the wrong one with exit 0, past the `switch-client -l` fallback. No single form resolves on
  every backend (tmux's window resolver rejects a pane id in the `session:%N` slot, and a
  native-id backend needs its own id passed through untouched), so the recording seam now asks
  the backend: `TerminalMultiplexer.current_return_target()` defaults to the bare native pane
  id — tmux and native-id backends behave exactly as before — and psmux overrides it to emit
  `=session:%N`, which releases carrying the psmux/psmux#483 fix resolve cross-server,
  degrading to the bare id only if the session probe fails. The replay sides treat the value
  as an opaque target and are unchanged.

- **A `worktree_seed` entry that silently copies nothing is now journaled (#230).** Under
  worktree isolation `provision_worktree` copies a seed only when the destination is absent —
  right for a file the checkout legitimately carries, but a _directory_ entry is skipped whole
  the moment any child is tracked, so `worktree_seed = ["_bmad"]` with a tracked `_bmad/custom`
  copies nothing at all, including the absent children that would clobber nothing. Provisioning
  is quiet by contract (it runs under the TUI), so the skip was invisible: user-authored config
  that reads as applied was a no-op. It now returns the skipped entries and the engine records a
  `worktree-seed-skipped` journal event; glob-expanded matches are excluded, since a plugin glob
  is expected to hit paths the checkout already carries. Behavior is otherwise unchanged —
  nothing new is copied.

- **A dry run the TUI cannot spawn opens a modal instead of taking the app down (#210).** The
  `run --dry-run` / `sweep --dry-run` workers called `run_captured` unguarded, and
  `@work(thread=True)` defaults to `exit_on_error=True` — so an `OSError` from the spawn itself
  (a venv deleted out from under `sys.executable`, `EAGAIN` off a loaded process table) escaped
  the worker and killed the whole app rather than the one modal. Both workers and the validate
  degrade now share a guard that reports the reason in the modal body.

- **`--json` output survives a console that cannot encode it (#200).** A JSON document is not
  necessarily ASCII: `diagnostics.render_json` serializes with `ensure_ascii=False` so its leak
  guard can scan values unescaped (#195, below), which lets a _non_-sensitive non-ASCII field —
  a localized `platform.release()`, say — reach stdout verbatim. Printing it to a console whose
  encoding could not carry it raised `UnicodeEncodeError`, in practice a legacy non-UTF-8
  Windows one. It failed safe rather than silently — the encode runs before any write, so
  stdout stayed empty instead of half-written — but `diagnose --json` still died on a machine
  where `--out FILE` would have worked. `machine.emit_document` now switches stdout to UTF-8
  before writing. Re-serializing the document as escaped ASCII would have been the smaller
  change and the wrong one: the leak check verified the unescaped bytes, and emitting anything
  re-derived from them is what that helper exists to prevent. `--out FILE` was never affected;
  it has always written `encoding="utf-8"`.

- **Leak self-check now matches JSON-escaped values (#195).** Two evasions became reachable
  the moment `diagnose --json` stopped also rendering the markdown report, since that raw-text
  pass was what had been catching them: `json.dumps` doubles backslashes, so a Windows home
  path (`C:\Users\…`) serialized to a form `_ABS_HOME_RE` did not match, and its default
  `ensure_ascii=True` escaped non-ASCII sensitive values to `\uXXXX`, hiding them from the
  pseudonymizer's stray-original check while `json.loads` handed the consumer back the
  original. The home-path rule now matches either separator form, and `diagnostics.render_json`
  serializes with `ensure_ascii=False` so the guard sees values as themselves. Both apply to
  the markdown path too; neither changes what a clean dump contains.

- **Resumed runs display the policy they actually enforce (#189).** `policy_snapshot` was
  stamped only at run creation. `resume` reloads `policy.toml` and enforces it — the
  per-story budget, every `SessionSpec` — but left the launch-time snapshot in place, and
  every display reads the snapshot: the run summary, `bmad-loop status`, the TUI, and the
  `policy` block of the `diagnose` bundle, which claimed to describe the run that was
  executed. Edit `limits.cache_read_weight` between launch and resume and the run enforced
  at the new weight while every surface reported the old one, silently up to 10x apart at
  the legal extremes (0.0–1.0). Resume now re-stamps the whole snapshot and persists it
  before the engine starts, restoring the documented contract that policy edits apply to
  resumes. A single `session-end` entry could likewise carry `tokens_weighted` at the
  snapshot weight beside `budget_weighted` at the live one; the two now agree by
  construction. Run scope and mode (`source`, `spec_folder`, `epic_filter`, …) stay pinned
  at launch as before — a policy edit still cannot redirect a live run.
  **Visible output change:** a run resumed across a weight edit re-weights its _whole_
  history, not just post-resume sessions, since totals are recomputed from raw counts (this
  is what the budget always did). A pre-0.8.2 run with no snapshot at all gets one on its
  first resume, so it stops displaying at the hardcoded 0.1 default. `run-resume` journal
  entries now carry `cache_read_weight`, `policy_changed`, and `cache_read_weight_was` when
  it moved, keeping per-session totals written under the old weight reconstructible.

- **Run summaries and `bmad-loop status` report weighted tokens, with both units labeled
  (#129).** The run-finished summary — stdout, the `ATTENTION` file, and the desktop
  notification all render from one place — reported the **raw** total, counting cache reads
  at full price, while every budget judges the **cost-weighted** total. On a cache-heavy run
  that overstates spend by ~6.5x, and neither figure said which unit it was. Both surfaces
  now lead with weighted and name both: `<weighted> weighted tokens (<raw> raw incl. cache
reads)`, matching the TUI, which has shown weighted since 0.7.12. `bmad-loop status` also
  gained a run-level `tokens:` line (it previously printed no run total at all).
  **Visible output change:** per-story `status` cells go from `<raw>t` to
  `<weighted>t (<raw> raw)`, so the number is both differently scaled and differently
  shaped — scripts scraping that column need updating. A story with only cache reads under
  `cache_read_weight = 0` correctly renders `0`, not `-` (which means no tokens at all).
  Displayed weights come from the run's persisted policy snapshot, so every observer
  reproduces the same number from `state.json` alone.

- **The TUI guide's task-table reference described the pre-0.7.12 columns.** It documented
  `tokens` as the raw total and omitted the `raw` column entirely; the run-header and
  journal sections were likewise silent on the weighted/raw split. Docs only.

- **`diagnose` leak self-check is now recoverable (#186).** A stray pseudonymized
  identifier (a per-field routing gap) is repaired by substituting its alias and disclosed
  in the report and on stderr, instead of refusing to emit any dump; residual failures name
  `sensitive[<ns>:<alias>]` instead of an opaque index, and the local `--legend` file is
  written even on refusal so the operator can decode it. PII/secret/path/username hits
  still fail closed.

- **Deferred-work bundles that adopt an existing story spec pass the baseline gate (#161).** A
  "follow-up review of story X" bundle is routed by `bmad-dev-auto` into that story's done
  spec, whose `baseline_revision` is the story's original dev baseline — necessarily older
  than the bundle's worktree cut, so the exact-match gate failed every such bundle after the
  session had already done its work. The bundle gate now accepts a claimed baseline that is
  an _ancestor_ of the orchestrator-recorded one (the session diffed a superset of the
  unit's changes); diverged or unknown baselines still fail, any git fault in the probe
  reads as not-an-ancestor, and sprint/stories modes keep the exact-match requirement.

- **A failed attempt inside a unit worktree auto-recovers instead of pausing with in-place
  instructions (#161).** The mid-drive dev retry was the only recovery path without an
  isolation guard: with `rollback_on_failure = false` it paused the run with manual-recovery
  instructions aimed at the operator's checkout — whose HEAD _is_ the baseline under
  worktree isolation, while the commits sat on the unit branch, so following them literally
  did nothing and invited a destructive reset of a tree the attempt never touched. A mounted
  unit worktree is disposable: the attempt's commits are parked on `attempt-preserve/` refs
  and the worktree resets regardless of the flag, which gates in-place (`isolation = "none"`)
  recovery only. The remaining reachable pauses name their tree (`git -C "<root>" …`).

- **A failed worktree teardown no longer crashes the run after the merge landed (#139).** When a
  process the just-ended session left running (e.g. pytest recreating `.pytest_cache`) makes
  `git worktree remove` fail with ENOTEMPTY, git still drops its admin entry, so the `force=True`
  retry failed with "is not a working tree" and that second `GitError` crashed the run. The
  teardown tail of `close_unit_workspace` never raises now: a failed worktree removal falls back to
  `rmtree` + `worktree prune` (the rmtree confined to the run's own worktrees dir — the path can
  arrive from persisted state), a failed branch delete is reported and swallowed, and both journal a
  `worktree-teardown-degraded` event — teardown is post-merge housekeeping. A failed forensic diff
  capture instead preserves the worktree + branch (they hold the only copy of a dropped unit's
  changes). `discard_worktree` gains the same removal fallback so a stuck dir can't block the
  resume re-mount.

- **A git call exceeding its timeout no longer crashes the whole run (#156).** Every git
  subprocess the orchestrator spawns now translates `subprocess.TimeoutExpired` into
  `GitError`, so the existing degrade guards handle a slow git like any other git failure.
  The rollback gate specifically (`_rollback_or_pause`'s dirty check — the reported crash
  path) degrades to assume-dirty: rollback OFF pauses with the manual-recovery notice and
  the worktree kept; ON / resolved re-drives still auto-recover behind their preserve
  steps. A `rollback-dirty-check-failed` journal entry records the fault. The bound is now
  configurable as `limits.git_timeout_s` (default 120).

- **Session timeouts now fire on time and leave a forensic trail (#157).** A
  `session_timeout_min` that fired but journaled its session-end 2h19 late — with zero record
  of _when_ the deadline was declared or why — is now timely and observable on three fronts.
  (1) `wait_for_completion` gains a **wall-clock co-bound**: a host suspend (macOS sleep)
  freezes `time.monotonic()`, silently extending the monotonic deadline by the nap's length;
  the wall clock keeps counting through a suspend, so it may now EXPIRE the deadline — never
  extend it (a stepped-back wall clock changes nothing, and all sub-waits stay monotonic).
  (2) The fire moment stamps the result (`timeout_fired_at`, `timeout_expired_clock` —
  `"wall"` alone is the suspend fingerprint) and appends a `timeout-fired` line to
  `tasks/<id>/session-lifecycle.jsonl`; each wait tick tops up a throttled
  `tasks/<id>/heartbeat.json` whose staleness under a still-live session diagnoses a frozen
  orchestrator (the previously uninstrumented gap). The engine journals **session-end
  unconditionally** — even a teardown that throws still records the ended session (status
  `aborted` when the outcome is unknowable), carrying `fired_at`/`teardown_s`/`expired_clock`.
  (3) Teardown is now a **verified kill escalation**: `terminate → wait → force_kill`, where
  `limits.teardown_grace_s` bounds the liveness-wait before escalating (default 20; `0` = a
  single unverified best-effort kill) and every escalation step carries its own bound, so a
  timeout can no longer hang on an unkillable session. Covers the tmux (`generic`) and
  `opencode-http` adapters alike. A frozen
  process still cannot run this code while frozen, but recurrence is now diagnosable rather
  than silent.

- **`validate` and `probe-adapter` no longer report antigravity's hooks as unregistered
  (#159).** The `antigravity-hooks-json` dialect keys `.agents/hooks.json` by hook-group name
  at the top level, with no `"hooks"` wrapper — but both readers looked up `"hooks"`, got `{}`,
  and reported a correctly-installed relay as missing (`FAIL: bmad-loop hooks not registered
for antigravity`, immediately after a successful `init --cli antigravity`). Both now share
  one `install.relay_registered()` helper that resolves each dialect's container shape, so the
  two call sites can no longer drift apart. `init`'s merge dedup keys on the narrow bmad-loop
  script markers rather than the bare `bmad_loop` substring, so an unrelated hook command whose
  path merely contains `bmad_loop` can't make init skip a registration that validate would then
  report missing.
- **The antigravity hook relay now reads agy's payload keys.** agy encodes hook payloads as
  protojson — `conversationId`, `transcriptPath`, `workspacePaths` — while the relay only tried
  snake_case plus copilot's `sessionId`. Every agy event therefore recorded a null
  `session_id`, and `cwd` was never populated (agy sends no `cwd`, only a `workspacePaths`
  list). Both the relay and the probe capture hook now try agy's casing, verified against a
  live 1.1.3 turn.
- **`probe-adapter antigravity` finds the transcript.** The shipped convention glob had the
  wrong filename — agy writes `transcript_full.jsonl`, not `transcript.jsonl`, under
  `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/brain/<conversationId>/.system_generated/logs/`. Corrected against
  a live capture. A live `--probe` now also prefers the `transcriptPath` the CLI hands the hook
  on stdin over the convention glob: the payload names _this_ turn's file, while a glob can
  only take the newest match and may land on an unrelated session.
- **antigravity: `usage_parser = "none"` is now documented as permanent, not pending.** A live
  capture confirmed agy's transcript carries only
  `step_index`/`source`/`type`/`status`/`created_at`/`content`/`thinking` — no usage block
  anywhere. agy does count tokens, but only inside `conversations/<id>.db`, an undocumented
  SQLite/protobuf store outside the `(transcript_path) -> TokenUsage` parser contract. Runs
  work; token columns stay empty.
- **antigravity: trust is exact-path (verified against `agy` 1.1.3).** `agy` blocks on an
  interactive "trust this folder" dialog for any workspace not listed verbatim in
  `settings.json` `trustedWorkspaces`; a trusted parent does not cover subdirectories, and
  `--dangerously-skip-permissions` does not bypass it (it covers tool permissions only).
  `isolation = "none"` (the default) works; `isolation = "worktree"` hangs on every run, since
  each worktree is a fresh untrusted path — now called out in the profile and setup guide, and
  tracked in #169. Replaces the profile's previous "verify during probe" placeholder.
- **Follow-up review sessions are no longer killed on their first Stop by the dev pass's stale
  `## Auto Run Result` (#160).** The review leg re-invokes bmad-dev-auto on the finalized (`done`)
  spec whose dev pass left that terminal marker; the review's own entry write lifted it past the
  adapter's launch-mtime floor, so the first result-less Stop read the stale marker as this
  session's result and ended the review mid-flight (the #109 stall grace never armed). The engine
  now strips the marker before every review launch — the frontmatter `done` stays, so step-01
  still routes to a review pass. The review-budget exhaustion defer reason now reports the last
  pass's actual status instead of always claiming a lingering follow-up recommendation.
- **`branch_per=run` + `keep_failed` no longer poisons a multi-story run after the first kept
  failure (#138).** The first story to end deferred under `keep_failed=true` left its worktree
  checked out on the single shared run branch, so every subsequent story's `git worktree add`
  collided ("branch already checked out") and insta-deferred with zero dev activity — one kept
  failure turned an N-story run into a 1-story run. A kept worktree under `branch_per=run` now
  detaches its HEAD (`git checkout --detach`), freeing the shared branch name for the next story
  while preserving the working tree, uncommitted changes, and the branch ref (still at the kept
  commit) for inspection; subsequent stories mount the run branch normally and get genuine
  attempts. Best effort — if the detach ever fails, the existing `worktree-open-failed` defer
  still surfaces the collision (no regression). The escalate-and-pause path was already safe: it
  halts the run rather than continuing, and resume frees the kept worktree before any sibling mounts.

- **Dev/review sessions can no longer livelock on their own wake nudges (#149).** The idle
  wake nudge is delivered as a submitted turn, so a session that merely _answers_ it ends in
  another result-less Stop — which refilled the nudge budget, re-armed the grace window, and
  repeated until `session_timeout_min`, burning a turn per cycle. Dev/review sessions now get the
  same monotonic cap injected workflow sessions already had: after `limits.dev_stall_nudges_cap`
  (default 6) total nudges the session is declared stalled instead (post-kill reconcile still
  rescues a finished one whose terminal artifact is on disk). The nudge text now also states that
  a prose reply cannot end the session. And each result-less Stop leaves a diagnostic breadcrumb
  (`tasks/<task_id>/resultless-stops.jsonl`: pending / not-terminal / stale-mtime / ambiguous /
  no-artifact / no-result-json) so _why_ a completed-looking session read as result-less is
  answerable from the run dir.

- **Split-story keys (`2-6a-…`) are no longer silently skipped (#144).** The sprint-status
  parser rejected story numbers carrying BMAD's split-story letter suffix, dropping exactly the
  stories that were split to be loop-tractable — invisible to `run`/`--story`/the TUI tree, and
  skipped by the epic-lift. The suffix is now a first-class `Story`/selector field: `--story 2-6a`
  (or `2.6a`, or `--epic 2 --story 6a`) selects exactly that half, while a plain `2-6` selects the
  whole `2-6a`/`2-6b` family in file order. `run` and `--dry-run` also print a stderr warning when
  sprint-status keys remain unparseable, instead of only journaling them.

- **Review leg repairs a finalize-tail death.** A review session that died between writing its
  terminal `## Auto Run Result` (`Status: done`) and flipping the spec frontmatter off the transient
  `in-review` marker left the orchestrator re-reviewing already-finished work — a burned review
  cycle. The review leg now runs the same terminal-status reconcile the dev leg does: when the prose
  says done and the frontmatter sits at a reconcilable non-terminal status, it advances the spec to
  `done` and re-folds the frontmatter's `followup_review_recommended` flag (only when present) before
  the convergence/damping gate reads it. Bookkeeping-only — every deterministic verify gate still
  runs against real on-disk/git state, so it cannot pass uncompleted work.

- **Claude sessions launch with `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_BACKGROUND_TASKS=1` (#109).** Claude Code
  could bias a dev session toward backgrounding its implementation sub-agent despite the
  bmad-dev-auto prompt ban; the session then ended its turn to await a completion notification,
  and a harness exit at that turn boundary stranded the sub-agent with the story stuck
  `in-progress` → manual-rollback pause. The shipped claude profile now forces subagents and bash
  to run synchronously — the behavior the skill contract already requires. Opt out with a custom
  profile in `.bmad-loop/profiles/`.

- **Resume no longer discards a story that already passed its pre-commit gates.** A host death in
  the COMMITTING window (phase persisted before `finalize_commit` ran and the DONE save stamped
  `commit_sha`) matched no resume arm — there is no COMMITTING-keyed session record to replay — and
  fell through to resume-restart, rolling back or pausing over fully-verified work. Resume now
  finishes the commit in place: the `pre_commit_gate` workflows are not re-charged (the persisted
  phase is durable proof they passed), the `pre_commit` hook re-fires (message regeneration and
  pause veto honored), and `finalize_commit`'s content-idempotence covers both the pre- and
  post-squash crash states. Sweep bundles get the same recovery in `_recover_inflight_bundle` (#115).

- **Resume no longer asks for a rollback of a completed session's committed work.** A host death
  in the post-verify decision window left the task persisted at `DEV_VERIFY`/`REVIEW_VERIFY`,
  where the resume replay matcher (which only knew the `*_RUNNING` phases) missed the
  durably-recorded completed session and fell through to resume-restart — pausing with a
  `git reset --hard <baseline>` instruction that would discard the attempt's finished, possibly
  already-pushed commits. Those phases now replay the recorded result through the normal
  verify/decide pipeline, and the rollback-OFF manual-recovery notice detects commits above
  baseline and leads with saving/checking them instead of a bare reset (#100).

- **The TUI no longer crashes on a private-mode CSI sequence in an adapter log.** The gemini
  CLI's startup burst includes XTMODKEYS `CSI > 4 ; ? m`; the marker byte sat _inside_ the
  params, so the private-marker strip filter missed it and pyte 0.8.2 raised a `TypeError`
  that killed the poll worker — and the whole dashboard. The filter now matches a marker
  anywhere in the params, and any escape sequence pyte still can't parse is dropped instead
  of propagating (upstream fix exists but was never released — selectel/pyte#202) (#111).

- **An unreadable spec no longer crashes the whole run.** Every spec read-back — the four verify
  gates, the reconcile/sprint/ledger bookkeeping passes, and the generic adapter's Stop poll — raced
  the dev skill's own writes, so a transient `OSError` (a TOCTOU truncation, a lock, an EACCES)
  escaped to `engine.run()` and abandoned every remaining story. Observation now degrades where
  repair still raises: verify gates return a retryable outcome naming the read fault (never a phantom
  status mismatch), bookkeeping passes skip and journal `spec-read-failed`, and the read-back poll
  treats it as not-yet-terminal, falling through to the existing stall/timeout → post-kill-reconcile
  ladder. Review routing re-derives `followup_review_recommended` from the finalized spec when a
  replayed result lacks it, so a fault that skips the reconcile re-fold can no longer silently skip
  a recommended follow-up review on resume (#97).

- **A resumed sweep re-drives its in-flight bundles by identity, not by bundle name.** `SweepEngine`
  recovered a bundle only from inside `_run_bundle`, which a cycle reaches after re-deriving the key
  from the _current_ triage plan — so a bundle re-armed by `bmad-loop resolve` survived a resume only
  because the cached `triage.json` reloaded and re-emitted the same name. Lose that cache and a fresh
  triage partitioned the ids under new names, silently orphaning the human's resolution. The sweep
  loop now opens with `_finish_inflight_bundles`, mirroring the base engine: every non-terminal `dw*`
  task is re-driven under its own persisted `story_key`, before the ledger is read, so its ids leave
  the open set and no fresh plan can re-bundle them. A still-escalated bundle stays terminal and
  untouched. A missing bundle intent file is regenerated from the task (the verbatim ledger entries
  become the contract; the triage prose is the only unrecoverable piece), and a bundle that survives
  to a cycle anyway is journaled + notified rather than dropped. Relatedly, a truncated or
  wrong-shaped `triage.json` now degrades to a fresh triage instead of crashing the whole run — the
  corrupt leg of this bug was previously unreachable. New journal events: `sweep-inflight-redrive` /
  `-stranded`, `sweep-intent-regenerated`. (#94)
- **Run ids are validated, so a run ref can no longer escape the runs directory.** A positional ref
  (`delete`, `stop`, `archive`, `resume`, `status`) was recomposed into a path raw, so
  `bmad-loop delete ../../x` deleted any outside directory holding a `state.json`; the hidden
  `--run-id` flag on `run`/`sweep` reached a directory name, a multiplexer session name and a git ref
  unchecked. A supplied id must now match `[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9_-]*` (≤ 120 chars, no reserved
  Windows device name) — rejected, never sanitized, so ids stay bijective with paths and sessions —
  and a ref that is absolute, climbs with `..`, or carries a separator skips the exact-match branch,
  falling through to partial matching over enumerated run dirs only. Ids recovered from the outside
  world — a `bmad-loop-<id>` session name, a `<kind>-<id>` control-session window name — pass the
  same validator before they steer a path. Partial refs unaffected (#104).

- **An abandoned patch-restore no longer smuggles its files into the corrected story's commit.**
  Re-arming a story whose previous re-drive had already applied a restore patch snapshotted that
  patch's new (untracked) files as _pre-existing_, so every later rollback preserved them and
  `finalize_commit`'s `add -A` swept the abandoned attempt into the corrected commit. The re-arm now
  parses the old latch (`verify.patch_new_files`) and subtracts its creations from the refreshed
  baseline snapshot — the re-drive's own reset then removes them. Best-effort: a missing or
  unreadable patch degrades to the old behavior instead of failing the resolve. Commits the
  escalated attempt left below the advanced baseline can't be reverted mechanically (the resolve
  session's own commits share that range), so they are journaled and echoed to stderr for the human
  to classify. New journal events: `stale-restore-excluded` / `-unparseable` / `-commits`.
  (closes #90)
- **Baseline-era untracked residue no longer vacuously satisfies the proof-of-work gate.**
  `has_changes_since` counted every untracked file. After an intent-gap halt the saved patch is
  untracked residue under the artifact dirs every reset deliberately protects, so a from-scratch
  re-arm — which never learns the patch's path — let a re-driven session that produced nothing but a
  spec status flip pass the gate on that file's mere presence, and `finalize_commit`'s `add -A` swept
  it into the story commit. The gate now subtracts the task's `baseline_untracked` snapshot. A `None`
  snapshot (a pre-upgrade run) still counts every untracked file — deliberately the opposite of
  `attempt_dirty`'s ignore-all, because a proof-of-work gate has to fail open toward "work happened".
  (closes #88)
- **The baseline-match verify gate was dead code for generic dev sessions.** The gate read the spec's
  `baseline_commit` and skipped itself when that key was absent — but `bmad-dev-auto` stamps
  `baseline_revision`; `baseline_commit` exists only in the orchestrator's synthesized `result.json`.
  In production the check never fired, so a spec claiming a stale or foreign baseline sailed through.
  The gate now reads either key, the idiom `devcontract` already used. The test fixture stamps
  `baseline_revision` like the real skill does, so it can no longer fabricate the key that hid this.
  (closes #89)
- **Unit keys with git-ref-illegal characters no longer break worktree runs.** `unit_branch_name`
  built `bmad-loop/<run_id>/<unit_key>` from the raw ids, so a key or `--run-id` carrying `:`, `..`,
  `@{`, a space or a trailing `.lock` cleared the (already-sanitized) worktree dir only to die at
  `git worktree add` with _"is not a valid branch name"_. Both segments now go through a new
  `platform_util.safe_ref_segment` — identity for clean ids, `-<hex8>` digest suffix otherwise, on
  git's alphabet rather than Windows' (`CON` is a legal ref; `a..b` is a legal filename). A
  `git check-ref-format` oracle test pins the agreement; the `attempt-preserve` recovery-ref slugs
  now reuse the same sanitizer instead of their own inline one. (closes #102)
- **The deferred-artifact stash overwrites its target atomically.** A story deferring a second time
  re-stashes the same spec filename over the previous one. `shutil.move` fell back to a non-atomic
  `copy2` there — which tears the stash on a mid-copy crash and fails outright on Windows when an
  AV/indexer handle turns the rename into a sharing violation. The stash now stages a copy inside the
  destination dir and routes through `platform_util.atomic_replace`, inheriting its win32 retry; the
  source removal gets the same retry via a new `platform_util.retrying_unlink`, since Windows denies a
  delete against an open handle exactly as it denies a rename-over. (closes #101)
- **A finished session whose final `Stop` hook was lost no longer loses its work.** A dev/review
  session that wrote its terminal spec but never delivered the `Stop` ended `stalled` — or `timeout`,
  when hooks were misconfigured and no event ever arrived — and the on-disk result was discarded.
  The adapter now re-reads the spec after the window is provably dead, rescuing a self-consistent
  successful terminal; every rescue still faces the full deterministic verify, and the journal records
  `session-rescued-post-kill` so it stays distinguishable from a live completion. (#95, closes #61)
- **A corrupt terminal artifact no longer crashes the whole run.** A spec truncated mid-write (a
  multi-byte UTF-8 sequence cut in half) raised out of the read-back and past the per-task boundary,
  marking the run `CRASHED` and abandoning every remaining story. The read-back now degrades an
  undecodable spec to "no result yet" — the session retries or keeps its verdict — and the post-kill
  rescue additionally keeps its verdict on _any_ read fault, so a best-effort rescue can never make
  things worse. The repair path still raises on purpose. (#95, closes #96)
- **Windows installs now pull `psutil` automatically** — moved from the opt-in `non-linux` extra to a
  platform-scoped core dependency (`sys_platform == 'win32'`), so the TUI liveness column no longer
  shows every run as `?` on a stock install. macOS keeps the `non-linux` extra; Linux stays dep-free.
  (#72, closes #71)
- **`bmad-loop-setup` no longer deletes live core BMAD config or the installer manifest.** In a
  multi-module BMAD v6 project the setup scripts hardcoded `core` (and `--also-remove _config`) into
  their delete lists, destroying `_bmad/core/config.yaml`, per-module config, and the whole
  `_bmad/_config/` manifest — breaking future `npx bmad-method install` upgrades. Cleanup now removes
  a directory only when it is a verified-redundant skill payload (has a `SKILL.md`, carries no
  config/manifest, and its skills are installed); live config dirs are protected and reported under
  `directories_protected`. The merge scripts read legacy config as fallback but never delete it. Same
  root cause as upstream `bmad-code-org/bmad-builder#96`. (closes #64)

## [0.8.1] — 2026-07-05

### Added

- **Attempt-preserve recovery refs are now bounded.** With `scm.rollback_on_failure` on, auto-rollback
  parks a failed attempt's committed work under `attempt-preserve/*` and its dirty worktree snapshot
  under `attempt-preserve-dirty/*`; nothing pruned them, so they grew unbounded. Run start now keeps
  only the newest `scm.preserve_keep` (default 20, `0` = never prune) per family by committer date and
  best-effort-deletes the tail — a stuck ref never wedges the ones behind it, and prune failures are
  journaled but never block the run. (#50 #54, closes #32 #49)

### Changed

- **The adapter shell-dialect seam is now an explicit, documented contract.** `new_window` /
  `new_parked_window` factor their shell-dialect fragments into overridable hooks (POSIX output stays
  byte-identical), and the `command` parameter's semantics are pinned in the ABC docstring
  (shlex-joined argv; operator handling is backend-defined). Relevant only to authors porting the
  adapter to a non-POSIX backend. (#47 #60)

### Fixed

- **A session that finished its work but crashed before the run recorded it no longer loses that work
  to a restart-and-rollback.** The engine now records a completed dev/review session behind a
  durability barrier _before_ running post-session hooks (usage is folded in afterward as best-effort
  metadata); on resume it consumes that durably-recorded result straight into verify/decide instead of
  restarting the attempt from baseline. A raw `KeyboardInterrupt` now records a controlled stop, and
  replay preserves the attempt/cycle/baseline. (#62, closes #57)
- **Several narrower resume-replay edges opened by that durability work are closed.** A host death in
  the post-session window of the _last_ allowed review cycle no longer drops a recorded clean review to
  a defer; a reconcile early-return no longer persists a pre-reconcile dict that could silently skip a
  recommended follow-up review; and triage/sweep and labeled plugin-workflow sessions no longer persist
  large, never-consumed result payloads into `state.json`. (#63)
- **A dev session is now completed only on a real Stop or window death, never on a terminal artifact
  glimpsed while the agent window is still alive.** The idle-tick and grace-expiry shortcuts could
  return "completed" mid-turn and let the run's cleanup kill a working agent, handing the engine
  half-written state. Both shortcuts are removed, liveness is re-probed immediately before the
  grace-expiry stall verdict, and a re-driven spec has its stale `## Auto Run Result` section stripped
  on both re-arm paths so a resolved re-drive can't be misread as its own terminal result. Result scans
  are now fence-aware, so an `## Auto Run Result` heading quoted inside a fenced code block is never
  mistaken for a real section (nor destructively stripped). (#53, closes #48 #52)
- **Long journal fields in the TUI now wrap with a hanging indent instead of spilling back under the
  timestamp and kind columns.** Each row renders as a fixed-width grid whose fields cell folds within
  its own column.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-07-03

### Added

- **New `pre_commit_gate` plugin workflow-injection stage.** Gate workflows can bind to
  `pre_commit_gate`, which fires unconditionally just before every commit — on the review-converged,
  review-skipped, and review-budget-rescue paths alike — while the phase can still legally defer.
  TEA's trace/nfr/review gates rebind to it, fixing blocking gates that were previously inert
  whenever a dev session recommended no review follow-up (so `on_pre_commit` fail-opened on the
  missing artifacts).

### Changed

- **BREAKING: the project is renamed `bmad-auto` → `bmad-loop`.** The distribution, console script,
  and CLI are now `bmad-loop`; the Python package is `bmad_loop` (was `automator`); the BMAD module
  code and marketplace plugin are `bmad-loop` (was `bauto`); per-project state moves from
  `.automator/` to `.bmad-loop/`. The GitHub repo is now
  [bmad-code-org/bmad-loop](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/bmad-loop) — old web and git URLs
  redirect. Clean break: no compatibility shims.
- **BREAKING: renamed public identifiers.** Env vars `BMAD_AUTO_*` → `BMAD_LOOP_*`; plugin
  entry-point group `bmad_auto.plugins` → `bmad_loop.plugins`; hook relays `bmad_auto_hook.py` /
  `bmad_auto_probe_hook.py` → `bmad_loop_hook.py` / `bmad_loop_probe_hook.py`; skills
  `/bmad-auto-{setup,sweep,resolve}` → `/bmad-loop-{setup,sweep,resolve}`; tmux session/window
  prefixes `bmad-auto-*` → `bmad-loop-*`; worktree branches `automator/<run-id>` →
  `bmad-loop/<run-id>`; TUI class `BmadAutoApp` → `BmadLoopApp`. Custom plugins, CLI profiles, and
  policy files that reference any of these must be updated.

### Fixed

- **A workflow session that finishes its work but never writes a completion marker no longer
  livelocks the run.** Each result-less Stop used to refill the stall-nudge budget, re-nudging a
  responsive-but-signal-less session until `session_timeout_min`. The engine now appends an explicit
  completion contract (absolute marker path + frontmatter shape) to every workflow-session prompt,
  and a new `limits.workflow_stall_nudges_cap` (default 3) caps the total nudges a workflow session
  may receive — degrading a still-missing marker to "stalled" in ~30 min instead of hours. Dev/review
  session nudging is unchanged.
- **On Windows, a live engine whose process identity can't be read now shows `UNKNOWN` instead of a
  false `INTERRUPTED`.** psutil raises `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED` for a process in another session or
  elevation, which the identity-aware liveness read had surfaced as dead — mislabeling running runs
  and weakening the resume/delete guards. Liveness is now tri-state (`alive`/`dead`/`unknown`) and
  biased away from false-dead; `resume`, `resolve`, `delete`, `archive`, and cleanup all surface and
  warn on `unknown` without ever letting an unverifiable pid block cleanup forever, and `resolve`
  gains `--force` to override a squatted-pid block.
- **A review session that appends to the deferred-work ledger no longer leaves a sweep bundle
  unclosed.** The bundle ledger is reclosed after review (journaled distinctly as
  `sweep-bundle-reclosed`), and the review prompt now states the ledger is append-only for sessions.
- **Worktree git-exclude patterns now anchor correctly on native Windows.** `install.py` normalizes
  backslashes in the per-worktree exclude paths so the ignore rules match (a no-op on POSIX).

### Migration

- **Reinstall the tool under its new name** — uv can't rename a package in place:
  `uv tool uninstall bmad-auto`, then
  `uv tool install "bmad-loop[tui] @ git+https://github.com/bmad-code-org/bmad-loop.git"`.
- **Re-run `/bmad-loop-setup`** (or `bmad-loop init` directly). `init` migrates a project in place:
  it strips the old `.automator/` Stop hook from each CLI's settings, removes the `bmad-auto-*`
  skill dirs, and carries `.automator/policy.toml` over to `.bmad-loop/policy.toml`. Setup folds the
  old `bauto` config into `bmad-loop` and clears the leftover `bauto` config section, stale
  `BMAD Automator Skills` help rows, and the `_bmad/bauto/` installer dir.
- **Legacy `.automator/` is left in place** (runs, archives, profiles, plugins) and can be deleted
  or hand-moved once the migration is confirmed; stale `.automator/*` gitignore lines are left
  untouched.

## [0.7.12] — 2026-07-01

### Added

- **The TUI dashboard now shows the cost-proportional weighted token total, with the raw total in a new
  column.** The `tokens` column and the run-header summary discount cache-read tokens by the run's
  `cache_read_weight` — the same weighting the per-story budget enforces — so the headline number
  tracks spend rather than context re-reads; the previous unweighted total moves to a new `raw` column.

### Fixed

- **The dashboard no longer crashes when a background poll lands as the screen is torn down or
  switched away.** A poll worker delivers its refresh on the UI thread; if that arrived just as the
  app quit or another screen opened, the query for the run table raised `NoMatches`. The apply now
  drops stale refreshes for a screen that is no longer running (while still updating one merely
  backgrounded under a modal).
- **A failed attempt's work is preserved before an auto-rollback hard reset instead of being silently
  discarded.** With `scm.rollback_on_failure` on (or on a resolved re-drive), a deferred or stopped
  attempt's commits above baseline are now parked under an `attempt-preserve/<run_id>-<head8>` branch,
  and its uncommitted working-tree diff — tracked edits and run-created untracked files alike — under
  `refs/attempt-preserve-dirty/`; both are recoverable by name and survive gc. A plain rollback that
  cannot create the ref refuses to reset and pauses for manual recovery rather than destroying work.
  The uncommitted snapshot is scoped to this run's own changes (never a pre-existing untracked file),
  commits under a synthetic identity so it works with no git user configured, and is keyed per retry
  so repeated rollbacks against the same baseline no longer overwrite each other's recovery ref.
- **Process liveness is now identity-aware, so a reused PID no longer reads as a live run.** A recycled
  pid (common on Windows) used to register as a false "alive" — blocking resume of a dead run,
  stranding worktree reclaim, leaking sessions, and showing dead runs as RUNNING. The pid file now
  carries a process-identity token that resume, stop, and the TUI verify against; on win32 the engine
  also ignores console SIGINT/SIGBREAK during a run so a ConPTY Ctrl+C broadcast can't kill it.
- **A story from a resolved escalation that still can't finish now re-escalates instead of being
  silently deferred.** When a human-resolved CRITICAL `blocked` escalation was re-driven and the
  re-drive couldn't reach `status: done` (e.g. the environment was still broken), the story used to
  exhaust its dev/review budget and plateau-defer — filing an unresolved blocker as deferred work and
  rolling back the implemented code. While `resolved_redrive` is latched, budget exhaustion now
  re-escalates (pauses for the human) instead of deferring, and the attempt's tree is preserved.
- **A resumed `--epic N` run stays scoped to its epic and no longer declares the epic "done" while
  stories remain.** `resume` rebuilt the engine without the run's `--epic`/`--story`/`--max-stories`,
  so a scoped run silently widened to every epic; with strict file-order story selection, deferring or
  finishing a story in an epic placed out of numeric order in the sprint board (e.g. one appended last)
  bounced selection to an earlier-in-file epic and fired a spurious "epic N complete" boundary,
  stranding the epic's remaining stories. The selector and cap are now persisted and restored on
  resume, and story selection exhausts the current epic before advancing — so an epic boundary fires
  only when that epic has no actionable stories left. Document-order epic execution is unchanged.

## [0.7.11] — 2026-06-30

### Fixed

- **A finalized story the review just won't stop recommending a follow-up for is now committed, not
  rolled back, when the review budget runs out.** Exhausting `limits.max_review_cycles` previously
  always deferred + reverted — discarding completed, review-passing work (frontmatter `status: done`,
  verify green) whose only "failure" was a never-clearing `followup_review_recommended`. The
  orchestrator now commits that work and re-files the lingering recommendation as a fresh open
  deferred-work entry; a story that itself came from such an entry is committed without re-filing, so
  a second non-convergence reaches a human instead of looping across sweeps. Worktree-isolation runs
  were unaffected — a deferred unit already keeps its worktree.

## [0.7.10] — 2026-06-29

### Fixed

- **Completed work left at the transient `in-review` frontmatter is no longer falsely deferred and
  rolled back.** A `bmad-dev-auto` session that dies in its step-04 Finalize tail can leave the spec
  frontmatter at the transient `in-review` marker while the `## Auto Run Result` prose already says
  `Status: done` — the same stale-frontmatter gate bug as 0.7.8 with a different value. The 0.7.8
  reconcile skipped `in-review` to protect the legacy `bmad-auto-dev` review-handoff, but that fork
  is retired and `in-review` is now only ever a transient marker, so it is reconciled to `done`
  before the gates run. Every deterministic gate still runs afterward, and a `followup_review_recommended: true`
  spec still triggers the follow-up review pass. Closes a re-sweep loop that re-ran and discarded the
  same completed bundles (~47M tokens/cycle).

## [0.7.9] — 2026-06-29

### Fixed

- **The multiplexer seam no longer leaks raw subprocess timeouts.** Every contract method now raises
  `MultiplexerError`/`TmuxError` or returns its documented sentinel instead of letting a 30 s tmux
  hang escape as a raw `subprocess.TimeoutExpired`.
- **A transient tmux hang no longer crashes a run or mis-reads a working session as dead.** The
  wait-loop tolerates an unknowable liveness probe — a persistent hang degrades to an honest
  `timeout`, never a false `crashed`.
- **An unexpected engine exception is now recorded instead of being lost to the parked control
  window.** The orchestrator writes a `run-crash` journal line + a `crash.txt` traceback, sets a
  `CRASHED` run status, and tears down the orphaned agent session — rather than dying with a
  traceback printed only to the pruned control pane.

## [0.7.8] — 2026-06-29

### Fixed

- **Completed `bmad-dev-auto` work is no longer falsely deferred when the skill leaves the spec
  frontmatter `status` stale.** The skill can finalize a run in its `## Auto Run Result` prose
  (`Status: done`) yet leave the YAML frontmatter at the template default `draft`; since every gate
  reads frontmatter, the sprint/ledger sync no-op'd and the story or sweep bundle deferred — losing
  tested work on rollback. The orchestrator now reconciles the frontmatter to the success status
  from the terminal prose before the gates run (journaled `spec-status-reconciled`). It reconciles
  only a `done` outcome from a non-terminal status, and every deterministic gate (worktree diff,
  dw-ids, verify commands, ledger) still runs — so the bookkeeping is repaired without trusting prose
  to pass a gate.

## [0.7.7] — 2026-06-28

### Fixed

- **Spec-status gates are now case- and whitespace-insensitive.** A hand-edited spec whose
  frontmatter carried a stray-cased `Done`/`In-Review` silently failed the dev/review gate and the
  story never advanced; every spec-frontmatter status read now normalizes through a single
  `verify.status_of` helper. The well-formed lowercase path is unchanged. Also fixes the
  manual-rollback notice, which rendered an invalid `git reset --hard the run's baseline commit`
  when no baseline was recorded — it now shows a `<baseline_commit>` placeholder.
- **Project-relative path guards reject `..` traversal and OS-foreign absolute paths.** A CLI
  profile or plugin manifest could declare a `config_path`/`skill_tree`/`seed_files`/module path
  that climbed out of the project with `../` — or, on Windows, a POSIX-absolute `/etc/...` that
  `Path.is_absolute()` failed to flag — and slip past the "must be project-relative" check. The
  guards now reject both, on every platform.
- **Persisted relative paths serialize with forward slashes.** A worktree run's `spec_file` and the
  resolve context's `resolution_path` were written with the host separator, so a `state.json` or
  context file produced on Windows read back with backslashes. Both now persist via `as_posix()` for
  a single cross-OS contract (a no-op on POSIX).
- **The TUI no longer shows a stale run after a same-size state rewrite.** The dashboard's
  stat-gated cache keyed on `(mtime_ns, size)`, so an atomic `state.json` rewrite of identical size
  within one coarse mtime tick (e.g. WSL2 drvfs) could be served stale. The engine rewrites
  atomically onto a fresh inode, so the cache signature now includes `st_ino`.
- **A dev session is no longer mis-stalled while it is actively working or legitimately waiting.**
  Building on `dev_stall_grace_s` (0.7.5), the idle-grace window now measures genuine _inactivity_
  rather than time-since-last-Stop: any growth of the session's pane log (a long productive turn, a
  streaming subagent) re-arms it, so a session that has finished implementation and is mid-review is
  no longer killed and rolled back. And because bmad-auto cannot re-invoke a turn that ended to await
  a background process, the grace window no longer dead-ends in a stall — on real silence the
  orchestrator wakes the session with up to `limits.dev_stall_nudges` (new, default 2) nudges before
  giving up; a genuine Stop restores the budget, so a slow-but-cooperative session waits up to
  `session_timeout_min` while a truly unresponsive one still stalls. `0` restores stall-on-grace-expiry.

## [0.7.6] — 2026-06-28

### Changed

- **The OS is now abstracted behind a registry of seams, so a non-tmux/native-Windows port is new
  files plus one registration line each — no core edits.** The terminal multiplexer is selected
  through a registry (`register_multiplexer`, by `sys.platform` with a `BMAD_AUTO_MUX_BACKEND`
  override) rather than hardcoded in `get_multiplexer()`, and the tmux backend split into a reusable
  `BaseTmuxBackend` extension point — every tmux invocation funnels through one overridable `_run()`
  primitive — with `TmuxMultiplexer` as a thin POSIX leaf, so a tmux-family backend (an eventual
  "psmux") overrides only the spawn primitive and the few divergent methods.
- **Process-lifecycle primitives moved behind a `ProcessHost` seam.** Politely-stop / force-kill /
  liveness / PID-reuse-identity now route through `get_process_host()` (registered like the
  multiplexer, with a `BMAD_AUTO_PROCESS_HOST` override); a `WindowsProcessHost` ships ready to
  register. Hook registration no longer hardcodes `python3` — it takes the interpreter prefix from
  `ProcessHost.hook_interpreter()` (POSIX `python3`; Windows `uv run --no-project python`), and
  `bmad-auto validate` runs a platform preflight that reports the selected backend's readiness and
  names the process host. Behavior on Linux/macOS/WSL is unchanged.
- **The bundled Unity plugin's teardown delegates pid lifecycle to `ProcessHost` and its helper
  scripts run under the orchestrator's own interpreter.** Plugin helper scripts are spawned via
  `sys.executable` (not a PATH-resolved `python3`), so a bundled script may import `automator` seams;
  `unity_teardown.py` now reaps leaked Editor/MCP processes through `get_process_host()` instead of
  re-implementing kill/liveness, gaining Windows behavior for free.

### Added

- **A consolidated [porting guide](docs/porting-to-a-new-os.md)** maps the four OS seams (terminal
  multiplexer, process lifecycle, hook interpreter, validate preflight), their registries and
  test-override env vars, and exactly what a native-Windows port costs end to end. The
  adapter-/plugin-authoring guides, ROADMAP, README, and FEATURES are updated to the post-registry
  world.

## [0.7.5] — 2026-06-28

### Added

- **Select and copy text from the TUI Log and Attention panes.** Click-drag highlights and `ctrl+c`
  copies (those panes are now selectable `RichLog`s with a working `get_selection`); `y` copies the
  whole active pane in one keystroke. The other panes are interactive widgets — hold your terminal's
  bypass modifier (Shift on most Linux terminals, Option on iTerm) to use its native selection. Copy
  rides OSC 52, so under tmux it needs `set -g set-clipboard on` to reach the system clipboard.
- **`bmad-auto diagnose` emits a sanitized diagnostic dump of a run/sweep** so a user can hand
  maintainers what's needed to debug a run without shipping any code, spec/story content, prompts,
  transcripts, file paths, or PII. It derives the diagnostic _shape_ — phase/token/session
  histograms, escalation counts, adapter/model, env, run-dir file sizes — and routes every
  content-bearing value through the audited `sanitize` chokepoint: identifiers (story keys,
  branches, SHAs) are pseudonymized to stable per-dump aliases so events still correlate, free text
  collapses to presence booleans, and the rendered output is re-scanned by a fail-closed leak
  self-check before writing. Defaults to the latest run; `--all`, `--out`, `--json`, and a
  local-only `--legend` are supported.

### Changed

- **The `sanitize` chokepoint now redacts credential-shaped strings.** Identifier-shaped secrets
  (`ghp_`/`sk-`/`AKIA`/`xoxb-`/JWTs and long high-entropy blobs) previously passed the slug gate
  verbatim; they are now `<redacted:secret>`, closing the same hole for `probe-adapter`.

### Fixed

- **A dev session that ends its turn to await a long-running background process is no longer
  mis-stalled.** A `bmad-dev-auto` session that yields to wait on a slow job (a Unity PlayMode run, a
  long test) and expects to be re-invoked on completion fired a result-less Stop — and since the
  generic dev adapter runs zero nudges, that was ruled stalled after only the 15s result grace,
  driving a retry that (with `scm.rollback_on_failure` off) paused the whole sweep for a manual
  reset. A new `limits.dev_stall_grace_s` (default 600s) opens an idle-grace window on a result-less
  dev Stop and re-arms it on each re-invocation, so only a genuinely idle gap with no terminal spec —
  or the session timeout — counts as a stall. Non-dev adapters keep zero grace and are unchanged.

## [0.7.4] — 2026-06-26

### Fixed

- **Deferred-work sweep no longer defers every bundle it just finished.** After the migration to
  the generic upstream `bmad-dev-auto` primitive, bundle dev sessions completed the work but were
  rejected by `verify_dev_bundle` with `result.json dw_ids [] do not match the bundle's […]`,
  retried to budget, deferred, and rolled the work back — so a sweep could never close a bundled
  entry. The retired dev fork used to echo the dw ids; the generic skill doesn't. The orchestrator
  already owns the bundle→dw-id binding, so the cross-check now passes when the session claims no
  ids, and the run exports `BMAD_AUTO_DW_IDS` so the synthesized result still carries them and the
  check stays live.

## [0.7.3] — 2026-06-26

### Fixed

- **The Log tab no longer shows only a single page for Claude runs.** Claude Code's new
  fullscreen TUI (an opt-in research preview) draws on the terminal's alternate screen and repaints
  in place, so the pane capture the Log tab emulates collapsed to the final frame — while
  line-oriented CLIs like codex still showed in full. The `claude` profile now forces the classic
  inline/scrollback renderer (`CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_ALTERNATE_SCREEN=1`), which overrides any `tui`
  setting and keeps output in native scrollback so the whole session is reconstructable. As a
  safety net, the log view also detects an alternate-screen switch and flags such a capture as
  showing only the final frame, pointing at the agent's full JSONL transcript.

## [0.7.2] — 2026-06-26

### Fixed

- **Worktree isolation no longer false-stalls a story that actually finished.** Under
  `scm.isolation = worktree` the `bmad-dev-auto` session runs with its cwd set to the worktree and
  leaves its terminal spec in the worktree's `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts`, but the dev
  adapter searched the main checkout's dir (resolved once at startup). The completed `status: done`
  spec was never found, so the orchestrator misread the session as stalled, rolled the unit branch
  back to baseline, and re-ran the same story. The adapter now resolves the spec directory from the
  live session cwd; in-place runs and artifact dirs configured outside the project tree are
  unaffected.

- **An uncommitted `policy.toml` edit no longer vanishes on rollback.** `policy.toml` is tracked but
  lives inside the kept `.automator` dir, so a rollback's `git reset --hard` to baseline silently
  reverted operator edits — a freshly enabled `scm.rollback_on_failure` could disappear before it ever
  took effect — and a lone policy edit could register as attempt dirtiness, trapping the
  manual-recovery loop. Rollback now restores `policy.toml` from its on-disk content unconditionally —
  so a config change committed after the baseline on an otherwise-clean tree survives too, not only
  one that rode a non-empty `git stash` snapshot — and the dirty check always excludes it, regardless
  of the preserve set.

- **Fixed a decision-toast notification race in the TUI test suite on Python 3.14.** Test-only; no
  runtime change.

## [0.7.1] — 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- **The Log tab no longer renders whole CLI sessions underlined.** Modern CLIs emit an XTMODKEYS
  sequence (`CSI > 4 ; 2 m`, "modifyOtherKeys") at startup that the pane emulator (pyte) misread as
  SGR 4 / underline-on — with no matching off present in a live capture — so every line came out
  underlined and hard to read. The log view now strips private-marker CSI sequences before emulation;
  genuine color, bold, and properly-closed underline styling is preserved.

- **Resolving a CRITICAL escalation no longer loops on a manual-rollback prompt when the resolve
  edited the spec.** 0.7.0 fixed the loop only for an already-clean tree, but the resolve workflow's
  whole job is to correct the frozen spec under the BMAD artifact folder (`_bmad-output/...`, which is
  tracked). So on resume the orchestrator saw a dirty tree and — with the default
  `scm.rollback_on_failure = false` — paused for a manual reset; because the dirty check diffs against
  the frozen `baseline_commit`, even committing the spec re-paused on the next resume, an endless loop.
  A resolved re-drive is human-initiated, so it now always auto-recovers regardless of the flag: the
  BMAD artifact folders are treated as orchestrator-owned — excluded from the dirty check and preserved
  through every reset of the re-drive (not just the resume-time cleanup) — so the spec correction
  survives while the failed attempt's source changes revert to baseline. This closes a latent sibling
  bug: with `rollback_on_failure = true` a _later_ mid-re-drive retry/defer reset previously ran with no
  preserve set and reverted the just-corrected spec silently, looping the re-drive.
  `scm.rollback_on_failure` still defaults OFF and now governs only unattended/stopped attempts; the
  manual-recovery notice (reached by stopped attempts only now) drops its resolved-cause wording.

- **A failed artifact restore during rollback now surfaces instead of silently dropping the
  correction.** When `safe_rollback` restores the preserved BMAD folders from its pre-reset snapshot, a
  genuine `git checkout` failure (corrupt snapshot, lock, IO) was swallowed alongside the benign
  empty-dir "pathspec did not match" case — so a corrected spec could vanish with no error and loop the
  re-drive. Real failures now raise; the empty-dir case stays tolerated.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-06-24

### Changed

- **Retired the `bmad-auto-dev` fork; the orchestrator now drives the upstream `bmad-dev-auto`
  skill unmodified** (bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD#2500, merged upstream) as its sole dev primitive.
  The skill is the inner autonomous coding session; everything automator-specific — escalation,
  sprint/ledger bookkeeping, repair-resume — stays in the orchestrator, which synthesizes
  `result.json` from the spec the skill leaves on disk. There is no fork to keep in sync with upstream.

- **Review is now a re-invocation of `bmad-dev-auto` on the done spec, not a separate skill.**
  `bmad-dev-auto` routes a `status: done` spec to a fresh step-04 review pass (BMAD-METHOD#2508), so
  the orchestrator's follow-up review just re-runs `/bmad-dev-auto <done spec>` in a fresh context.
  `review.enabled` still gates whether that follow-up pass runs at all; the new `review.trigger` knob
  (see Added) decides when it fires. The loop converges when a pass finishes `done` without the skill
  setting `followup_review_recommended`, still bounded by `limits.max_review_cycles` (default 3).

- **The skill commits each iteration; the orchestrator squashes to one commit per story.**
  `bmad-dev-auto` now commits its own work at the end of a successful run (BMAD-METHOD#2506). At
  finalize the orchestrator collapses that chain plus its own sprint/ledger writes back onto the
  pre-dev baseline into a single commit carrying the configured message — `pre_commit`/`post_commit`
  hooks and `scm.commit_message_template` stay authoritative.

### Added

- **Skill-recommended review (`review.trigger`).** `bmad-dev-auto` self-reviews inline and sets
  `followup_review_recommended` on a `done` spec when its changes warrant an independent pass
  (BMAD-METHOD#2505). The orchestrator consumes it: `review.trigger = "recommended"` (new default)
  runs the follow-up `bmad-dev-auto` review pass only when flagged; `"always"` keeps the old
  run-every-story behavior. Adjustable in the TUI and `policy.toml`. The follow-up loop stays bounded
  by `limits.max_review_cycles` (default 3) — the oscillation guard — so a skill-recommended review
  can never loop indefinitely.

- **Non-bundled-skill preflight.** `bmad-auto validate` and run/sweep/resume start verify that
  `bmad-dev-auto` and the two adversarial review hunters (`bmad-review-adversarial-general`,
  `bmad-review-edge-case-hunter`) — which `bmad-dev-auto`'s step-04 invokes inline on every run — are
  installed in each active CLI skill tree, failing loudly with remediation instead of stalling mid-run
  on an `Unknown command`. Worktree provisioning copies these upstream skills from the main repo,
  since they are not bundled in the wheel.

- **`result.json` `workflow` is now an enforced contract on the dev path.** `verify_dev` /
  `verify_dev_bundle` reject a mismatch against `verify.DEV_WORKFLOW` (`"auto-dev"`); the synthesized
  result carries `"auto-dev"`. Review re-runs the same skill, so it carries the same tag, and
  `verify_review` stays purely disk-derived — it is never handed the result.json.

- **Pluggable terminal-multiplexer seam (groundwork for native Windows).** All tmux usage now goes
  through a `TerminalMultiplexer` ABC (`get_multiplexer()`); `TmuxMultiplexer` is the only code that
  shells out to `tmux` and the only place the POSIX `sh -c` parked-window trailer lives. The generic
  adapter (renamed `generic_tmux.py` → `generic.py`), `runs.py`, `tui/launch.py`, `probe.py`, and
  `tui/data.py` all route through it, so a future non-tmux backend slots in with no engine changes.
  Behavior on Linux/macOS/WSL is byte-identical; **no native-Windows backend ships yet** (see [ROADMAP](docs/ROADMAP.md)).

- **POSIX portability hardening + CI guard.** Scattered POSIX-only primitives are guarded behind a
  platform seam — `SIGKILL` fallback, detach kwargs, `terminate_pid`, `os.devnull` — and the Unity
  plugin degrades off Linux (`/proc` → `psutil` via a new optional `windows` extra, `/tmp`, `cp -a`
  CoW, symlinks, `start_new_session`), keeping every Linux fast path unchanged. A new
  `tests/test_portability_guard.py` AST/byte scan blocks new POSIX-only patterns from creeping back,
  with sanctioned exceptions carrying `# portability:` acks.

- **Adapter & profile authoring guide.** `docs/adapter-authoring-guide.md` now carries the complete
  `CLIProfile` / `HookSpec` field reference (the single canonical schema home) and a "writing a new
  adapter class" section for non-tmux transports — linked from the README documentation index.

### Removed

- **Retired the bundled `bmad-auto-dev` and `bmad-auto-review` skills.** `bmad-auto init` now installs
  three bundled skills — `bmad-auto-resolve`, `bmad-auto-sweep`, `bmad-auto-setup` — and the upstream
  `bmad-dev-auto` skill (from a recent bmm module) is a hard prerequisite. `bmad-auto-review`'s
  adversarial review is fully covered by `bmad-dev-auto`'s inline step-04 (Blind + Edge-Case hunters);
  the independent Acceptance Auditor layer is dropped, and the two hunters are now always-required base
  skills rather than gated on `review.enabled`. The canonical `deferred-work-format.md` moved into
  `bmad-auto-sweep`, its remaining owner.

### Fixed

- **Resolving a CRITICAL escalation no longer loops on a manual-rollback prompt.** Re-arming an
  escalation requests a clean rebuild, which in non-worktree (in-place) runs means resetting to the
  story baseline. With the default `scm.rollback_on_failure = false` the orchestrator paused for a
  manual reset — but never cleared `baseline_commit`, so following the instructions (`git reset --hard`,
  then `resume`) re-paused on the next resume, an endless loop. `_rollback_or_pause` now no-ops when the
  tree is already at baseline (nothing this attempt touched), so a clean tree — including one the
  operator just reset — proceeds straight to the re-drive. The same guard suppresses the spurious prompt
  when an escalation left no changes at all.
- **Manual-recovery notice wording.** The prompt no longer claims the story "failed" — it now reflects
  the real cause ("escalation was resolved; re-driving needs a clean baseline" vs. "attempt was stopped").
- **Resolved escalations now actually re-drive instead of HALTing on a stale `blocked` spec.** `verify_dev`
  only recorded `task.spec_file` on a fully successful session, so a dev session that escalated with a
  `blocked` spec (the common escalation case) left it unset. `rearm_escalation` then had no spec path to
  flip to `ready-for-dev`, so on resume `bmad-dev-auto`'s step-01 routing re-HALTed on the still-`blocked`
  frontmatter — a second loop. The orchestrator now captures the spec the session produced when it
  escalates or defers (the synthesized result names it even on a HALT), so re-arm flips the status and
  the re-drive proceeds, and a deferred story's spec is stashed as intended.
- **Copilot dev stage no longer stalls on a subagent `agentStop`.** Copilot fires `agentStop` for
  every subagent turn too — with an empty `transcriptPath` and a tool-use session id, not the main
  session's turn-end. With dev decoupled to `bmad-dev-auto` (which implements via subagents), that
  premature Stop reached the dev stage, where 0 nudges made the orchestrator declare an outright stall
  before the skill wrote its terminal spec (same root cause as the 0.6.4 review stall). A new
  per-profile `subagent_stop_without_transcript` (true for `copilot`) ignores a `Stop` carrying no
  transcript, so the main session's real turn-end drives completion — and restores usage tallying,
  since that Stop carries the transcript.
- **Process liveness/termination no longer risks signaling the wrong process.** A corrupt
  `engine.pid` read as `0` or negative would make `os.kill` target a process group — for `0`, the
  orchestrator's own — so `pid_alive`/`terminate_pid` now reject non-positive PIDs before signaling.
  The remaining liveness checks (`runs.py`, `tui/data.py`) that called `os.kill(pid, 0)` directly now
  route through `pid_alive`, since on Windows `os.kill(pid, 0)` maps to `TerminateProcess` and is
  destructive; a CI guard blocks bare `os.kill(_, 0)` from regressing.

## [0.6.4] — 2026-06-21

### Fixed

- **Copilot token usage now records (was always 0).** Copilot writes its token totals only in
  the trailing `session.shutdown` events line, ~1s after `agentStop` — usage was sampled before
  it landed. `read_usage` now polls the transcript for a short grace, driven by a new per-profile
  `usage_grace_s` (8s for `copilot`, 0 elsewhere = read once).
- **Copilot multi-turn reviews no longer stall.** `agentStop` fires per response turn, so a
  parallel-subagent review ends several turns and tripped the global `stop_without_result_nudges`
  default of 1. New per-adapter floor (5 for `copilot`), overridable per stage via `[adapter.review]`.

### Added

- **`[adapter] usage_grace_s` / `stop_without_result_nudges`** (base + per-stage
  `[adapter.dev|review|triage]`), editable in the settings TUI. Unset = inherit the CLI profile's
  shipped default.

### Changed

- **Copilot docs.** Pin a capable model — the free GPT-5 mini default silently skips steps in
  multi-step dev/review — and it's the Copilot **CLI** binary that's supported, not the VS Code
  extension.

## [0.6.3] — 2026-06-21

### Fixed

- **GitHub Copilot adapter (CLI 1.0.63).** Turn-end is `agentStop`, not PascalCase `Stop`
  (which never fires) — every session previously read as a timeout. Remapped events, dropped
  the non-existent `PreCompact`, and the shared hook relay now reads camelCase payload keys
  (`sessionId`/`transcriptPath`). Probe mode sends its prompt verbatim so a skill-templating
  `prompt_template` no longer renders a missing-skill path that stalls the turn.

### Added

- **Copilot token accounting.** New `copilot-events` `usage_parser` reads
  `~/.copilot/session-state/*/events.jsonl` (`data.modelMetrics.<model>.usage.*`); the `copilot`
  profile is wired to it (was `usage_parser = "none"`).

## [0.6.2] — 2026-06-21

### Added

- **`bmad-auto probe-adapter` (alias `collect-adapter-data`).** A self-service command that
  collects and sanitizes everything needed to finalize a CLI adapter profile — the hook payload
  shape, transcript location/format, and token-usage schema for a `usage_parser` — so a user of
  any coding CLI can paste back a clean, content-free report. A default zero-launch **scan** reads
  on-disk conventions; opt-in `--probe` does a live capture in an ephemeral workspace. All output
  passes through one audited PII sanitizer (token counts and field names survive; paths, prose, and
  emails are redacted).
- **GitHub Copilot CLI profile.** Bundled `copilot` profile (Copilot CLI ≥ 2026-02): `-i`
  interactive launch, VS Code-compatible `Stop` hook, `--allow-all-tools` for unattended runs.
  Still pending live E2E and a `usage_parser` — `probe-adapter` captures the token schema to write
  one.

- **Adapter authoring guide.** New [adapter authoring guide](docs/adapter-authoring-guide.md)
  walks through finalizing a CLI profile with `probe-adapter` (scan vs probe, the PII model, and
  the parser-writing loop); `probe-adapter` is added to both command references.

## [0.6.1] — 2026-06-20

### Added

- **Short run refs (Docker-style).** Every command that takes a run id (`status`, `attach`,
  `resume`, `resolve`, `stop`, `delete`, `archive`) now accepts a partial — the tail after the
  last `-` (e.g. `a1b2`, or as few chars as stay unique). Full ids still work; an ambiguous ref
  fails listing the candidates. New `bmad-auto list` (alias `ls`) prints each run/sweep with its
  short ref, type, and status.
- **Flexible `--story` selection.** `bmad-auto run --story` now takes more than the exact full
  key: an epic+number (`--epic 3 --story 1`, `--story 3-1`, or `--story 3.1`) or a slug fragment
  (`--story user-auth`). Full keys still work. Mismatches are caught before the run launches with a
  targeted error — no match, ambiguous slug, or matched-but-not-actionable.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- **Rollback no longer wipes non-automator files.** A failed in-place attempt previously ran
  `git reset --hard` + a blanket `git clean -fd` over the whole checkout, which could delete a
  project's `_bmad-output/` and any other untracked files (only `.automator/` and two artifact
  subdirs were spared). The orchestrator now never runs a blanket `git clean`: it reverts the
  attempt's tracked changes and removes only the untracked files **that run created**, preserving
  pre-existing untracked files and the entire `_bmad-output/` tree.

### Changed

- **Auto-rollback is now opt-in (`[scm] rollback_on_failure`, default off).** With it off the
  orchestrator never touches your working tree on a failed attempt — it pauses the run with bold
  manual-recovery instructions (back up untracked files → `git reset --hard <baseline>` → restore).
  Turn it on for the safe automatic rollback above (it discards the attempt's uncommitted work, so
  it warns when it fires). Worktree isolation (`scm.isolation = "worktree"`) sidesteps this entirely.

## [0.5.1] — 2026-06-20

### Added

- **`bmad-auto clean` + `[cleanup]` retention.** Reclaims disk from concluded runs: tears down
  git worktrees a mid-flight stop orphaned (freeing each worktree's Unity `Library/` + MCP-server
  build — the main accumulation source), trims the heavy `worktrees/` tree from runs kept for
  history (they still list in the TUI), and archives/deletes runs past `[cleanup] run_retention`
  (default 10). Only finished/stopped runs are touched; `--keep`/`--dry-run`/`--retain`/`--hard`.
  Every `run`/`sweep` start auto-reconciles worktrees a prior **finished** run leaked
  (`auto_clean_on_finish`); the Unity plugin's new `post_run` hook clears the IvanMurzak MCP
  server's `/tmp/<company>/<product>/*.zip` downloads + truncates its editor log (`clean_tmp`).
- **Test Architect (TEA) plugin.** New bundled, opt-in `tea` plugin that wires the BMAD
  Test Architect Enterprise module into every run and sweep as advisory-by-default quality steps.
  Enable with `[plugins] enabled = ["tea"]`; it injects six TEA workflows — test-design, ATDD,
  automate (after dev) and trace, NFR, test-review (after review) — and fails fast at startup if
  TEA isn't installed (`npx bmad-method install` → Test Architect). Each step is individually
  toggleable; the three gate steps (`trace`/`nfr`/`review`) can be flipped to **blocking**, so a
  failing FAIL/CONCERNS gate escalates the unit for human review at commit instead of landing
  (fail-open: a missing or unparseable artifact never blocks). See the
  [TEA plugin guide](docs/tea-plugin-guide.md).
- **Settings-driven workflow `enabled` / `blocking`.** A plugin can let an operator disable a
  `[workflows.<name>]` step or flip its gate from policy via the `<name>_enabled` / `<name>_blocking`
  setting convention — no code, and byte-identical for plugins that don't declare them. Documented
  in the [plugin authoring guide](docs/plugin-authoring-guide.md#making-a-workflow-configurable).
- **Manage plugins from the TUI.** The settings screen (`g`) gains a **Plugins** section: a roster
  of every discovered plugin with an enable toggle (writing `[plugins] enabled`). A plugin's
  settings appear only once it is enabled — revealed live, hidden otherwise — so the form stays
  scannable; data-only plugins are always on. Saving now also runs each enabled plugin's coupling
  check (e.g. unity `editor_mode` ↔ `scm.isolation`), blocking an invalid combo at save time
  instead of mid-run.

- **MIT license + open-source community files.** The project is now MIT-licensed (© BMad Code, LLC)
  with a trademark notice, and ships `CONTRIBUTING`, `SECURITY`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT`, and GitHub
  issue/PR templates as it becomes a first-class citizen in the BMAD org.
- **Uninstall procedure.** The [setup guide](docs/setup-guide.md#uninstalling) now documents a
  full teardown — reclaim disk, remove `.automator/`, skills, hooks, and gitignore lines, then
  `uv tool uninstall`.

### Changed

- **Renamed the project and package to `bmad-auto`.** The distributable is now `bmad-auto`
  (install with `uv tool install 'bmad-auto[tui]'`) and the repo has moved to the BMAD org at
  [bmad-code-org/bmad-auto](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/bmad-auto). The CLI command, skills
  (`bmad-auto-*`), tmux sessions, and `BMAD_AUTO_*` env vars are unchanged. The separate legacy
  [bmad-automator](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/bmad-automator) project is unrelated and stays
  as-is. Re-run `uv tool upgrade bmad-auto --reinstall` to move an existing install onto the new name.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-06-20

### Added

- **Plugin system.** New `automator.plugins` package — a general extension layer: a `plugin.toml`
  manifest (metadata, declarative `[hooks.<stage>]`, a `[[settings]]` schema, optional in-process
  `[python]`), a folder-drop loader with builtin/project overlay (and a locked seam for
  entry-point packaging later), a trust allowlist (`[plugins] enabled` in `policy.toml`), and a
  registry that isolates plugin failures. A dropped `[python]` plugin is never imported unless
  explicitly enabled. Plugins can **observe, veto (defer/pause/skip), and mutate** a shared
  context at every run/sweep lifecycle stage via the hook bus, with an O(1) no-op fast path so
  zero-plugin runs stay byte-identical.
- **Dynamic, TOML-driven settings.** The settings schema moves to `data/settings/core.toml`
  (presentation only; defaults/options referenced from the `policy.py` dataclasses, never
  duplicated), the TUI settings screen renders from a registry, and an enabled plugin's
  `[[settings]]` appear under `[plugins.<name>]`.
- **Workflow plugins.** A plugin can declare a `[workflows.<name>]` table that injects an extra
  agent session at a lifecycle stage (`post_dev_phase` / `post_review_result`, run by the `dev` or
  `review` adapter); the prompt substitutes `{story_key}`/`{run_id}`/`{scripts}`. Non-blocking by
  default (advisory); a blocking workflow that fails routes through the normal defer path. Ships
  with a worked-example plugin (`examples/plugins/guardrails/`) exercising every extension point and
  a full [plugin-authoring guide](docs/plugin-authoring-guide.md).

### Changed

- **The game-engine layer is now a plugin.** Unity runs entirely through the plugin system, with
  no engine-specific code in the core loop. Enable it with `[plugins] enabled = ["unity"]` and
  configure it under `[plugins.unity]` (`editor_mode`, `mcp`, `unity_path`, `ready_timeout_sec`,
  `ready_grace_sec`). Behavior — the readiness gate, `per_worktree` Editor setup/teardown, MCP
  agent routing, and Library priming — is unchanged.

### Deprecated

- The `[engine]` policy block is deprecated in favor of `[plugins] enabled = ["unity"]` +
  `[plugins.unity]`. Existing `[engine]` configs still load but emit a deprecation warning and are
  folded onto the `unity` plugin; explicit `[plugins.unity]` values win. `[engine]` will be
  removed in a future release.

## [0.4.4] — 2026-06-19

### Fixed

- Unity `per_worktree`: auto-recover merge-back when a competing Editor leaks asset writes
  (`.cs.meta` GUIDs, asmdef edits) into the **main** checkout. Previously git refused the merge
  pre-flight because the target already held the unit's incoming files as dirt, escalating the unit
  spuriously. Merge-back now cleans only the leaked copies of this branch's incoming files (journaled
  as `merge-target-cleaned`); dirt outside the branch's path set still escalates as possible operator
  work, with a distinct message.
- Unity `per_worktree`: route **every** worktree CLI's MCP config at the worktree's Editor, not
  just the dev agent. When dev and review use different CLIs (e.g. `dev=claude`, `review=codex`),
  the review agent could read a main-repo-seeded config and route its asset writes into the main
  checkout. Each agent's config is now written to the deterministic per-path port and verified; a
  mismatch fails the setup hook (the unit defers) instead of leaking writes.

### Changed

- Unity engine plugin: pin the `unity-mcp-cli` verification stamp to **v0.81.1** (subcommand
  signatures re-checked; no call-site changes). Documents the new upstream **dev-control HTTP
  bridge** (dev-only, off by default, not wired) in the [Game Engine MCP guide](docs/game-engine-mcp-guide.md).

## [0.4.3] — 2026-06-18

### Added

- **Game-engine plugin layer (opt-in; Unity).** New `[engine]` policy section adapts the
  dev/sweep cycle to projects that drive a live engine Editor through an MCP (Unity via
  [IvanMurzak/Unity-MCP](https://github.com/IvanMurzak/Unity-MCP) or
  [CoplayDev/unity-mcp](https://github.com/CoplayDev/unity-mcp)); off by default. Plugins ship
  like CLI profiles — bundled under `automator/data/engines/<name>/`, overridable in
  `.automator/engines/<name>/`. `editor_mode` couples to `[scm] isolation`: `shared` runs the
  agent in place on the operator's open Editor; `per_worktree` gives each unit its own managed
  Editor. A readiness gate blocks until the Editor + MCP report ready before each unit, deferring
  on timeout instead of starting against a half-open Editor.
- **Unity `per_worktree` mode.** Each unit runs in its own git worktree with a dedicated Editor:
  - Launches in local (Custom) mode — `bootstrap-local` plus `open --start-server true` so the
    Editor hosts its own per-path MCP server; this makes `wait-for-ready` a real readiness signal
    before any client connects. Connection knobs overridable via `BMAD_AUTO_UNITY_MCP_*`
    (`…_LOCAL=0` keeps the prior cloud launch).
  - Primes the worktree `Library` with a reflink/CoW copy of the warm main `Library`, so Unity
    reimports incrementally rather than cold — a cold import on a large project crashes the import
    workers (Burst `SIGFPE` writing `VirtualArtifacts`). Tunable via `BMAD_AUTO_UNITY_LIBRARY_SEED`
    and `…_SEED_MODE` (`reflink`|`copy`|`symlink`|`off`).
  - Teardown quits the Editor and reaps its child `gamedev-mcp-server` on completion or pause, so
    neither leaks across runs (a leaked server holds its port and breaks the next run).
  - Cold-launch grace via `[engine] ready_grace_sec`; MCP skill tree seeded into each worktree via
    `seed_globs`; `init` now gitignores `.automator/cache/`.
- **Worktree config seeding.** A fresh worktree checks out tracked files only, so a project's
  gitignored MCP/CLI configs (`.mcp.json`, `.claude/settings.json`, …) were missing — isolated
  sessions then timed out reaching their MCP and escalated as spurious spec errors. Each loaded
  adapter's configs are now copied in before launch, via new `[scm]` knobs `seed_adapter_defaults`
  (default on) and `worktree_seed` (extra paths). Both are in the TUI settings editor.
- **Game Engine settings in the TUI.** All six `[engine]` keys (`name`, `editor_mode`, `mcp`,
  `unity_path`, `ready_timeout_sec`, `ready_grace_sec`) are now editable in the settings editor
  (`g`) under a collapsible titled **Game Engine**; the `editor_mode` ↔ `[scm] isolation` coupling
  is validated on save. New authoring docs: [Writing a Game Engine plugin](docs/game-engine-plugin-guide.md)
  and [Writing a plugin for a specific Editor MCP](docs/game-engine-mcp-guide.md) (full
  `BMAD_AUTO_UNITY_*` env-var reference).

### Changed

- Default `limits.session_timeout_min` raised from 45 to 90 minutes — the old default cut off
  substantial units, especially MCP-driven Unity sessions where each Editor step is a slow
  round-trip. Override per project under `[limits]`.

### Fixed

- `bmad-auto cleanup` (and the TUI `c` action) no longer stops other projects' live runs. tmux
  sessions are global but were named only `bmad-auto-<run_id>`, so a run id absent from the current
  project looked like a prunable orphan and matched another project's active run. Sessions and
  windows are now stamped with their project (`@bmad_project`); cleanup prunes only the current
  project's, while still clearing true same-project orphans. Pre-existing untagged sessions are
  left untouched.

## [0.4.2] — 2026-06-17

### Fixed

- Answering sweep decisions over an attach now returns you to your terminal. After the
  last decision in a cycle was answered, the session previously stayed in the orchestrator
  window instead of handing control back. The sweep now returns the terminal as soon as the
  current cycle's decisions are answered and continues running bundles in the background.
  `bmad-auto attach` lands on the orchestrator window when a decision is pending and restores
  your previous session on exit.

## [0.4.1] — 2026-06-16

### Fixed

- Worktree isolation (`[scm] isolation = "worktree"`) now works. Isolated runs previously
  failed on the first session with `Unknown command: /bmad-auto-dev`. Worktrees are now
  created under the run directory (`.automator/runs/<run_id>/worktrees/<unit>`) instead of
  inside `.git/`, and each worktree is provisioned with the bundled skills and signal hook so
  project commands resolve correctly.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-16

First release with **opt-in git-worktree isolation** for runs and sweeps. The default is
unchanged: with no `[scm]` configuration, work happens in place on the checked-out branch
exactly as before (`isolation = "none"` is byte-for-byte identical to prior behavior).

### Added

- **Configurable `repo_root` + Workspace seam.** `_bmad/bmm/config.yaml` gains an optional
  `repo_root` key (defaults to the project dir) that decouples "where git work + code sessions
  happen" from "where run state lives." All code/git/artifact access now routes through a single
  `Workspace` indirection, so redirecting work into a worktree is a localized change rather than a
  sweep across the engine.
- **Worktree isolation** — `[scm] isolation = "worktree"` runs each story (and each sweep bundle)
  in its own `git worktree` on a dedicated `automator/<run_id>[/<story>]` branch cut from the
  target branch, then merges it back into the target **locally** (merge strategy `ff`, `merge`, or
  `squash`). The main checkout stays free while a run is in flight, and run state stays in the main
  repo's `.automator/` — never inside a worktree. Knobs: `branch_per` (`story` | `run`; `run`
  shares one branch across the run and forces `delete_branch = false`), `target_branch` (default =
  the branch checked out at run start; a configured branch is created/checked out in the main repo
  and never inside a worktree), `delete_branch`, and `keep_failed`.
- **Failed-unit forensics.** A deferred/escalated unit's full diff (tracked + untracked) is
  preserved to `run_dir/failed/<unit>/changes.patch`; with `keep_failed` (default) its worktree +
  branch stay mounted for inspection. `failed_diff_max_mb` (default `5`) caps the per-file size of
  untracked files in that patch — oversized files are skipped with a labelled marker — and
  `failed_diff_unlimited` lifts the cap entirely (logs a warning when active).
- **`commit_message_template`** — optional `[scm]` template (`{story_key}` / `{run_id}`
  substituted) used for story and sweep-bundle commits when set.
- The full `[scm]` section (isolation, `branch_per`, `target_branch`, `merge_strategy`,
  `delete_branch`, `keep_failed`, the failed-diff caps, and the commit template) is editable from
  the TUI settings screen. (`max_parallel` is omitted while it stays inert.)
- **Low-frame-rate TUI mode.** `bmad-auto tui --low-frame-rate` (or `[tui] low_frame_rate = true`,
  editable from the settings screen) caps Textual to 15fps and disables animations by setting
  `TEXTUAL_FPS` / `TEXTUAL_ANIMATIONS` before the app starts. Fixes the repaint tearing/garbage
  seen when driving the dashboard over a slow or high-latency link (SSH, Tailscale), where a 60fps
  update stream can't drain in time and partial frames paint over old ones. The setting takes
  effect the next time the TUI launches; an explicit `TEXTUAL_FPS` in the environment still wins.
- **git worktree / branch / merge / diff primitives** in `verify.py` (worktree add/remove/list/
  prune, `create_branch`, `merge_branch`, `capture_diff`, …), unit-tested in isolation.

### Changed

- Worktree-mode integration is always **serialized** — unit branches merge into the target one at
  a time. `max_parallel` exists as a validated knob but is clamped to `1` (inert) until internal
  parallel fan-out is built.
- Story spec paths are persisted **relative to the worktree** in `state.json`, so a kept-failed
  run's state stays portable if the worktree is later moved.
- The run reclaims its worktree scaffolding on clean completion (deliberately-kept failed/escalated
  worktrees are left in place and journalled so they can be found).
- **TUI settings editor now collapses every section by default.** Each policy section
  (`gates`, `limits`, `scm`, …) starts collapsed with a one-line description in its header, so the
  grown-large form scans at a glance — expand only the section you want to edit. `ctrl+e` toggles
  all sections open/closed at once.

### Fixed

- A detached HEAD or unborn repo no longer lands worktree merges on an unreferenced commit — the
  run pauses with a clear reason instead. A merge conflict against the target keeps the unit branch
  for manual merge and escalates; `capture_diff` now raises on a genuine `git` error (rather than
  silently truncating the patch) and `merge_branch` reports a failed abort/reset.
- **Editing settings no longer dirties the worktree for validation.** `worktree_clean()` (the
  pre-flight gate for `run`/`sweep`/`validate`) now ignores `.automator/policy.toml`, so saving a
  change in the settings editor no longer forces a commit of the config before the next command.
  Only that one file is exempt — the deferred-work ledger under `.automator/` still commits as
  before.

## [0.3.2] — 2026-06-15

### Added

- **Arrow-key navigation and Enter-to-edit on the settings screen.** Up/Down now move focus
  between fields (additive — Tab/Shift+Tab still work), and Enter activates the focused field
  by type: it opens a dropdown (`Select`), toggles a switch, or enters cursor-edit mode on the
  multi-line box (`TextArea`), where the box's own Up/Down then move the cursor; Escape leaves
  edit mode without leaving the screen. Plain text/number inputs stay editable on focus, so
  Enter is a no-op there. Implemented with priority bindings gated by `check_action` so an open
  dropdown or an editing TextArea keeps Up/Down, and Escape still pops the screen in nav mode.

### Fixed

- **Attaching to answer a deferred-work decision now returns you where you came from.**
  When a prompting sweep blocks on a decision (or you open a resolve session), pressing
  `a`/`R` switches a tmux client into the orchestrator's control window so you can answer
  there — but on exit it left you stranded in the control session on the parked
  exit-status prompt instead of back at the TUI. The control window now records where the
  attach came from and, once you press enter, returns you: it switches the client back to
  the TUI's own pane when the TUI runs inside tmux (i.e. your original session), or
  detaches the throwaway attach client so the suspended TUI resumes when it runs outside
  tmux. Windows nobody attached to interactively still park unchanged.

- **Empty optional numeric fields no longer flash a red "invalid" outline.** The start-run
  and start-sweep modals draw their numeric inputs (`epic`, `max stories`, `max bundles`)
  with `type="integer"`, which under Textual validates on blur and — with the default
  `valid_empty=False` — treats an empty string as invalid. Tabbing past a blank field that
  is explicitly optional ("blank for all", "blank for no limit") therefore tripped the red
  `$error` border. The inputs now pass `valid_empty=True`, matching the settings screen, so
  leaving them blank is accepted silently while a typed integer still validates.

### Changed

- **Clearer review toggle on the settings screen.** The `[review]` switch showed only the
  raw key `enabled`, with no hint about what it controls. It is now relabelled "separate
  review session" and carries a muted caption spelling out both states (ON: triple review
  runs in a dedicated 2nd session · OFF: quick-dev runs its own tri-review inline). The
  change is display-only — the config key and save logic are unchanged.

- **`bmad-auto-setup` now upgrades, not just installs.** Re-running the skill (or invoking
  it with `upgrade`) on an already-installed project is detected as an upgrade — it runs
  `uv tool upgrade bmad-automator --reinstall` (the `--reinstall` is required for a git
  source) and re-lays the per-project skills with `bmad-auto init --force-skills`, then
  reports the before → after version. Previously a re-run was treated as a config-only
  update: it left `--force-skills` off, so `init` silently skipped every existing skill
  dir and the project kept stale skills against the upgraded tool. Upgrade is detected from
  an existing `bauto` config section and/or a uv-managed `bmad-automator`, and the tool
  follows `main` by default with an offer to pin a release tag. Docs (README "Upgrading",
  `docs/setup-guide.md`) now describe the skill-driven upgrade alongside the manual ritual,
  and the stale `uv tool upgrade bmad-automator` hint (missing `--reinstall`) is corrected.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-06-14

Maintenance release. Also backfills the previously-undocumented `[0.3.0]` notes below.

### Changed

- `scripts/sync_version.py` now runs `uv lock` as part of the version stamp, so a
  version bump regenerates the pinned lock in one command. CI runs `uv sync --locked`,
  which fails the install step on a stale lock (hit while cutting 0.3.0); folding the
  relock into the stamp keeps a bump a single command. Idempotent, with a loud non-zero
  exit if `uv` is missing or the lock fails.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-14

First release carrying the optional review toggle.

### Added

- **Optional review pass** — new policy `[review] enabled` toggle (default `true`). When
  disabled, a run skips the separate fresh-context `bmad-auto-review` session: the dev pass
  runs quick-dev's own internal triple-review unattended and finalizes the story straight to
  `done` — one session per story instead of two, with verify commands still gating the
  commit. The flag flows to the dev session via `BMAD_AUTO_SKIP_REVIEW=1`; the dev skill (not
  the engine) writes the `done` status, preserving the engine-never-writes-status invariant.
  Global scope: also governs deferred-work sweep bundles. Exposed as a switch in the TUI
  settings screen.

### Changed

- **Install / upgrade docs** — the README install block now offers main-tracking vs.
  pinned-tag installs, and a new "Upgrading" section documents the two-step ritual
  (`uv tool upgrade --reinstall` — required for a git source — then re-lay per-project skills
  with `init --force-skills`). The `bmad-auto-setup` skill is corrected to use `--reinstall`
  (plain `uv tool upgrade` reuses the cached git commit and won't pull new code) and notes the
  skill re-lay step plus tag pinning.
- Regenerated `uv.lock` for the 0.3.0 version pin.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-14

First versioned release since the initial `0.1.0`. Consolidates everything built since then and
realigns the version across the Python package and the BMAD-module metadata (which had drifted to a
placeholder `1.0.0`). All version-bearing fields are now kept in sync by `scripts/sync_version.py`,
enforced in CI.

### Added

- **TUI dashboard** (`bmad-auto tui`) — live, read-only view of runs, the sprint tree, the
  deferred-work ledger, a per-story phase/token table, and tailing of the journal / pane log /
  ATTENTION file, plus an integrated launcher for new runs and an in-app policy editor.
- **Deferred-work sweeps** — `bmad-auto sweep` triages the ledger against the real codebase and
  runs full dev → review → verify → commit on actionable bundles; `--repeat` re-triages each cycle;
  `bmad-auto decisions` surfaces and pre-answers human decisions earlier sweeps left open.
- **Interactive escalation resolution** — `bmad-auto resolve <run-id>` opens a resolve agent to
  disambiguate a frozen spec on a CRITICAL escalation, then re-arms the story and resumes.
- **Multi-CLI / multi-agent support** — a generic tmux adapter driven by declarative TOML profiles,
  with built-in `claude` (default), `codex`, and `gemini` profiles and per-stage overrides
  (`[adapter.dev|review|triage]`) for client/model/extra args.
- **Run operations** — `stop`, `delete`, `archive`, and `cleanup` for tmux artifacts of finished or
  stopped runs.
- **Cost-weighted token budgeting** — per-story `max_tokens_per_story` using cache-read weighting.
- **Bundled skill module** — the `bmad-auto-*` skills ship inside the wheel and are laid down by
  `bmad-auto init` into `.claude/skills/` and/or `.agents/skills/`.

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** policy `[adapter]` no longer accepts the flat `model_dev` / `model_review` keys; use
  the `[adapter.dev]` / `[adapter.review]` / `[adapter.triage]` sections instead (a clear error
  points at the replacement).
- **BREAKING:** build system migrated from setuptools + pip to **hatchling + uv**. Install with
  `uv tool install "bmad-automator[tui] @ git+…"`; develop with `uv sync --all-extras`. All docs,
  CLI hints, the `bmad-auto-setup` skill, and the eval-runner Dockerfile now use uv.
- **BREAKING:** module layout renamed `module/` → `skills/`; the canonical skills live under
  `src/automator/data/skills/`.

### Fixed

- BMAD-method installer could not locate `module.yaml` for the `bauto` module
  (`collectAgentsFromModuleYaml` / `writeCentralConfig` warnings): restored a repo-root
  `module.yaml` descriptor so the installer's shallow lookup resolves the module again.
- Replaced stale `pip install` instructions across docs, CLI hints, the setup skill, the
  eval-runner Dockerfile, and the module greeting with their uv equivalents.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-10

- Initial release: deterministic dev → review → verify → commit orchestrator for the BMAD
  implementation phase, driven by a Python control loop with hook-based session transport and
  resumable on-disk run state.
