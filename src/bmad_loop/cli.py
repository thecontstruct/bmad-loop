    ``rc`` is a released contract, so these values do not move; the enum just gives
    the existing numbers a name at their use sites. Being an ``IntEnum`` it returns
    from ``main()`` (``-> int``) and reaches ``sys.exit`` transparently.

    - ``OK`` — a command handler returned success (``args.func`` returns it, not
      ``main`` directly).
    - ``FAILURE`` — a typed error surfaced to the dispatch tail, or the broad
      backstop caught an unexpected exception; both print ``error: …`` to stderr.
    - ``USAGE`` — an argparse usage error (unknown subcommand, bad flag). argparse
      raises ``SystemExit(2)`` before dispatch, so this names its number rather than
      being returned here.
    - ``INTERRUPTED`` — Ctrl+C (SIGINT) escaped ``main()`` outside ``engine.run()``
      (config load, engine construction, a handler with no run loop). 130 = 128 +
      SIGINT(2), the shell's conventional code for an interrupt; uncaught this path
      already reached 130 (CPython re-raises SIGINT) but as a bare traceback, so
      ``main()`` catches it for a clean one-line exit at the same code. The in-run
      interrupt converts to a clean ``RunStopped`` (``engine.py``) and never reaches
      here — a Ctrl+C during a run stays rc 0.

    ``--dry-run`` returns before `_require_base_skills` (cmd_run/cmd_sweep), so a

    the upstream rename that preview is actively misleading rather than merely
    incomplete: the forwarding shim IS a valid slash command, so a previewed
    ``/bmad-dev-auto`` reads fine and would HALT an unattended session on the
    shim's interactive migration gate.

    Mirrors both of the refusals the dry-run's early return skips past, and only
    those: the finding list `_require_base_skills` gates on, and the #414 isolation
    conflict `_reject_isolation_conflict` refuses ahead of it. Reading the same
    sources as the gates themselves is what keeps the preview from disagreeing with
    the real command about what "runnable" means. Severity-filtered to `problem`
    for that same reason — `_require_base_skills` ignores warnings, so reporting one
    as a `FAIL:` line would promise an abort that never comes. The dirty-tree, queue
    and run-id gates are deliberately not part of this banner.

    Takes the whole :class:`~bmadconfig.ProjectPaths` rather than `project` alone
    because the #414 refusal is a fact about the two roots' relationship; every
    other probe here still reads `paths.project`, which is what `init` wrote and
    what a session's own root resolution will re-derive.

    The exit code deliberately stays 0. A dry-run is a diagnostic — refusing to
    print the schedule would withhold the very thing the operator asked for, and

    refuses to act on a drifted entry, so nothing here gates anything; a stale
    record must not be able to block a run that would otherwise start. The
    directions carry different ids because their remedies differ: an entry the
    committed state has moved past is stale bookkeeping to discard
    (`registry-stale`), while a board sitting at `awaiting-operator` that no
    record claims (`park-record-missing`) is an obligation whose spec nothing
    can find. Before #356 that second arm was the fresh-clone NORM and shared
    `registry-stale`; now the record travels with the park's own commit, so a
    missing one is always evidence of something — a record write that failed at
    park time, a park from a version that recorded only machine-locally, a
    checkout without the park's branch, or a record deleted without confirming.

    An INTERRUPTED confirmation gets its own id rather than being reported as
    stale, because its remedy inverts: re-running `confirm` finishes it. Saying
    "the entry is stale and confirm will refuse it" about a story confirm now
    completes would be the same class of lie the state itself is."""

    """Warn when a story declares ``closes_deferred:`` ids the deferred-work
    ledger does not carry, or declares them in a shape nothing can read (#234).

    At clean close the orchestrator flips each declared id to ``status: done
    <date>`` + a ``resolution:`` line. An id that names no entry — a typo, or an
    entry reworded/renumbered since the spec was written — annotates nothing, and
    the run says so only in the journal, where nobody looks until the retro that
    the annotation exists to spare. Saying it at preflight is the whole point:
    the declaration is fixable before the run, not after.

    Runs in **both** queue modes, because the declaration exists in both. With
    ``spec_folder`` (stories mode) each manifest entry is checked together with
    its id-resolved spec, unioned — the manifest half is what makes this genuinely
    a *pre*-flight, since those ids are readable before the story has ever been
    dispatched. Without it (sprint mode) the story specs already sitting in the
    artifacts dir are scanned instead; those are written by `create-story` ahead
    of the run, which is exactly while a typo is still cheap to fix. Reporting
    only in stories mode left sprint-mode operators with nothing but a journal
    line after the fact.

    An id present but already ``done`` is a declaration a prior run already
    satisfied (a resume re-drives the same close), so it stays silent — the same
    classification the engine's close hook makes, for the same reason. Everything
    else it can journal is reported here: an absent id, an id whose ledger entry
    carries neither an ``open`` nor a ``done`` status (nothing will be marked, and
    the remedy is in the ledger rather than in the declaration), and a
    wrong-container declaration, which names real intent that would otherwise
    close nothing and say nothing. Covering only two of the three left the third
    to be discovered in the journal after the run it should have preceded.

    A ledger that cannot be read at all is reported as well. Staying quiet there
    is not the same trade as staying quiet about an unparseable manifest: the
    manifest is already reported by ``queue.stories-manifest``, while nothing
    else in ``validate`` reads the ledger, so silence meant reporting success for
    a preflight that checked nothing.

    Never a failure. The annotation is traceability, not a gate, so a stale
    reference must not be able to block a run that would otherwise start.
