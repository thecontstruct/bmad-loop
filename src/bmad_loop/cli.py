    the existing numbers a name at their use sites. Being an ``IntEnum`` it returns
    from ``main()`` (``-> int``) and reaches ``sys.exit`` transparently.

    - ``OK`` — a command handler returned success (``args.func`` returns it, not
      ``main`` directly).
    - ``FAILURE`` — a typed error surfaced to the dispatch tail, or the broad
      backstop caught an unexpected exception; both print ``error: …`` to stderr.
    - ``USAGE`` — an argparse usage error (unknown subcommand, bad flag). argparse
      raises ``SystemExit(2)`` before dispatch, so this names its number rather than
      being returned here.
    - ``INTERRUPTED`` — Ctrl+C (SIGINT) escaped ``main()`` outside ``engine.run()``
      (config load, engine construction, a handler with no run loop). 130 = 128 +
      SIGINT(2), the shell's conventional code for an interrupt; uncaught this path
      already reached 130 (CPython re-raises SIGINT) but as a bare traceback, so
      ``main()`` catches it for a clean one-line exit at the same code. The in-run
      interrupt converts to a clean ``RunStopped`` (``engine.py``) and never reaches
      here — a Ctrl+C during a run stays rc 0.

    policy themselves — selects under the persisted choice. Tolerant of a broken
    policy file: diagnostics must keep working on a misconfigured host, and the
    commands that need policy re-load it loudly themselves.

    The registry export belongs *here*, and not at backend construction, for two
    reasons this is the only place that satisfies at once: it is the last point
    that still knows the project (``--project`` has been parsed, no handler has
    run) and it precedes every psmux spawn in the process, the ctl session the
    TUI mints included. Backend construction knows neither — a factory takes no
    arguments, and ``detect_multiplexers`` builds every registered backend for a
    diagnostic table, which must not move a registry as a side effect.
    ``runs.export_psmux_registry_root`` never raises, on the same
    keep-diagnostics-working rule as the policy read above.

    It also *overrides* an ambient ``PSMUX_DATA_DIR`` rather than honouring it —
    the root is derived, always, so that two processes given one project cannot
    disagree about where its sessions live (the full argument is in that
    function). Overriding an operator's variable silently is how someone loses an
    hour to `psmux ls` showing nothing, so it is said once, here, at the only

    site, the auto-triggered child sweep in `_sweep_factory`, shares the refusal but
    not this disposition: it has no rc channel, so it raises (see the comment there).

    Keyed on provisioning-or-arming a run against the config, NOT on Engine
    construction: `cmd_resolve` constructs no Engine and delegates to
    `_resume_paused_run` for that, but `runs.rearm_escalation` mutates persisted run
    state — advancing the attempt baseline and re-stamping the spec — against the
    same `repo_root` this refuses, and it does so BEFORE the delegate is reached. A

    provision — `_configure_mux` reads the file on every command and builds nothing;

    refusal on a mistyped `repo_root`, reporting a broken git to someone whose git
    is fine and burying the isolation refusal that names the real fault. `validate`
    and `diagnose` probe the project root for the same reason.

    FAIL CLOSED on both arms. An unparseable `git version` is refused by

    unspawnable, timed out — is refused here: a run that cannot ask git its version
    is not a run that should reach `git worktree add`. Neither degrades to "assume
    it's fine", which is the only failure mode that matters for a floor.

    `profiles/*.toml` on its own — the digest via `config_digest`, the adapters via
    `make_adapters` — so a write landing between them stamped a baseline for config
    the run never launched.

    This is NOT the child gate's check-then-use, and must not be read as one: there
    is no comparison here. At launch the on-disk config IS the trust anchor, so an
    adversary who can write in that gap could equally have written BEFORE it and
    been blessed outright, with no timing at all — the race grants no capability.
    The defect runs the other way, toward over-refusal. This pin is the one
    baseline a session cannot reach (`_sweep_factory` holds every later auto-sweep
    to it from MEMORY, unlike resume's disk-backed advisory), so a pin describing
    bytes the run did not launch makes those children refuse the config the parent

    a child that started), but that buys nothing here: a wrong pin refuses the next
    trigger exactly as it refused the last.

    `cmd_sweep` deliberately keeps its fresh read: a human started it, and the pin
    it stamps gates no child.

    Same `ProfileError` -> `SystemExit` contract as `_trusted_config_digest`, for

    ``--dry-run`` returns before `_require_base_skills` (cmd_run/cmd_sweep), so a
    project whose skills are broken still gets a plausible-looking preview. Since
    the upstream rename that preview is actively misleading rather than merely
    incomplete: the forwarding shim IS a valid slash command, so a previewed
    ``/bmad-dev-auto`` reads fine and would HALT an unattended session on the
    shim's interactive migration gate.

    Mirrors the refusals the dry-run's early return skips past, and only those:
    the under-floor git `_reject_under_floor_git` refuses first, the finding list
    `_require_base_skills` gates on, the #414 isolation conflict
    `_reject_isolation_conflict` refuses ahead of it, and the unregistered adapter
    kind `make_adapters` aborts on (`_unknown_adapter_kinds` — a preview reads none
    of the fields that would give the misconfiguration away).

    The git floor belongs here for the reason the dirty-tree and queue gates do
    NOT: it is a fact about the HOST, so it cannot come true between this preview
    and the real command the way cleaning a tree can. Both of its arms are
    mirrored — too old, and could not be run at all — because `cmd_run` aborts on
    each, and a banner silent on the second would promise a run guaranteed to
    exit 1. Reading the same
    sources as the gates themselves is what keeps the preview from disagreeing with
    the real command about what "runnable" means. Severity-filtered to `problem`
    for that same reason — `_require_base_skills` ignores warnings, so reporting one
    as a `FAIL:` line would promise an abort that never comes. The dirty-tree, queue
    and run-id gates are deliberately not part of this banner.

    Takes the whole :class:`~bmadconfig.ProjectPaths` rather than `project` alone
    because the #414 refusal is a fact about the two roots' relationship; every

    pauses instead of proceeding. This side exists to move the answer earlier —
    the operator learns before the run starts, and learns about *every* gated

    The two must keep agreeing about what "unlanded" means (only an explicit

    ``None`` when the queue could not be read, which is not the same answer as an

    readability, so this check stays quiet rather than raising — but a caller that
    read ``[]`` as "nothing is gated" would report an all-clear about a queue it
    never saw. The whole walk is inside the guard for the same reason: the
    per-story ``resolve_story_spec`` globs the filesystem too, and leaving it
    outside turned a degraded check into a traceback out of ``validate``.

    Stories mode has no status column — the manifest is a flat schedule and the
    story's own spec carries the status — so actionability comes from
    :func:`stories._classify`, the predicate the scheduler itself picks with.
    Dropping only ``done`` is not the same line the sprint board draws:
    ``ACTIONABLE_STATUSES`` is a two-element allowlist, so ``blocked`` and the
    rest are already out on that side. In stories mode a ``blocked``, sentinel,
    ambiguous or unknown-status entry is one :func:`stories.schedule` refuses to
    dispatch (``SCHEDULE_WEDGED``), so treating every non-``done`` state as
    actionable made ``validate`` exit nonzero over a gate on a story the queue
    could not run — and made the two queue modes disagree about what a gate
    refuses.

    What is shared is that per-entry predicate and deliberately NOT the scan's
    stop rule: ``schedule`` gives up at the FIRST wedged entry, and mirroring that
    here would drop every later story from this list. Two reasons not to. A wedge
    is a property of some *other* story, and ``run --story <id>`` scans that entry
    alone (``selector``), so a later story really is reachable while the wedge
    stands — while ``validate`` takes no story selector and so cannot know which
    run is coming. And stopping would let one blocked entry near the top of a
    manifest silence the gate check for everything below it, which is the failure
    this check exists to prevent, arriving by a quieter route than the one it
    fixed. Over-reporting a real gate on a story that needs an unrelated
    resolution first is the cheaper wrong answer, and dispatch still refuses

    entry reworded/renumbered since the spec was written — annotates nothing, and
    the run says so only in the journal, where nobody looks until the retro that
    the annotation exists to spare. Saying it at preflight is the whole point:
    the declaration is fixable before the run, not after.

    Runs in **both** queue modes, because the declaration exists in both. With
    ``spec_folder`` (stories mode) each manifest entry is checked together with
    its id-resolved spec, unioned — the manifest half is what makes this genuinely
    a *pre*-flight, since those ids are readable before the story has ever been
    dispatched. Without it (sprint mode) the story specs already sitting in the
    artifacts dir are scanned instead; those are written by `create-story` ahead
    of the run, which is exactly while a typo is still cheap to fix. Reporting
    only in stories mode left sprint-mode operators with nothing but a journal
    line after the fact.

    An id present but already ``done`` is a declaration a prior run already
    satisfied (a resume re-drives the same close), so it stays silent — the same
    classification the engine's close hook makes, for the same reason. Everything
    else it can journal is reported here: an absent id, an id whose ledger entry

    wrong-container declaration, which names real intent that would otherwise
    close nothing and say nothing. Covering only two of the three left the third
    to be discovered in the journal after the run it should have preceded.

    Never a failure. The annotation is traceability, not a gate, so a stale
    reference must not be able to block a run that would otherwise start.

    flip, the advance and the re-stamp write. Split by PRODUCER, not on the prefix,

    spelled `rearm-*` for the re-arm it degrades, not for the abandoned restore it
    measures. The commits pair is what the human must act on — nothing else will tell
    them — and it takes both, because `stale-restore-commits` is written only when the
    probe ANSWERED: without its twin, that record's absence reads as "clean" whether or
    not anyone could tell.

    Named for the re-arm, not for the stale restore: it began as a `stale-restore-*`
    echo and now carries the baseline family too, so a name from the narrower era

    it resumes in the same gesture.

    The baseline records are echoed because a failed advance means the re-drive
    rebuilds against the tree as it stood BEFORE the resolve, and the re-stamp then
    deliberately refuses to write a sha it did not earn. All of it is warn-only by
    contract (a project that is not a repo must not fail re-arm), so without an echo
    the whole degrade is journal-only — the invisibility #640(b) exists to end, not to
    relocate.

    """Name what each legacy multiplexer registry still holds after the sweep.

    Silent on the normal path — the list is empty on every platform without a
    registry namespace and on every machine that never ran the pre-registry
    build. When it is not empty, saying nothing would be the failure: cleanup
    prints a removal count, and a count that quietly excludes sessions it chose
    not to migrate reads as "everything is clean". stderr rather than stdout, the
    `unverifiable_pid` precedent, so `cleanup > log` keeps the receipt; in
    `--json` mode this lives in the document instead and stderr stays empty.

    **One line per registry, naming it.** There is more than one legacy registry
    now — psmux's default, and any root this process displaced — and the
    operator's next action is to open the one holding these sessions. A message
    that named the default for all of them sent the reader to a registry the
    sessions are not in, and at documentation about a registry that is not
    theirs. `runs.legacy_registry_leftovers` maps names to registries so this
    does not have to guess, and omits a registry that holds nothing so no line
    here points somewhere empty.

    Points at the docs rather than printing a command. One of the things named
    here is the machine-wide control session, and `psmux kill-session` on it kills
    every child process in every one of its windows — including, on this
    backend, a window still running an engine (the parked wrapper runs the
    command first and parks only after it exits). A remedy this prints has to be
    safe to run at the moment it is printed; that one is not, so the care lives
    where there is room to state it.

    Deliberately unconditional on dry-run: a preview that omits the remainder
    would disagree with the run it is previewing."""
