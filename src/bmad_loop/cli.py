    the existing numbers a name at their use sites. Being an ``IntEnum`` it returns
    from ``main()`` (``-> int``) and reaches ``sys.exit`` transparently.

    - ``OK`` — a command handler returned success (``args.func`` returns it, not
      ``main`` directly).
    - ``FAILURE`` — a typed error surfaced to the dispatch tail, or the broad
      backstop caught an unexpected exception; both print ``error: …`` to stderr.
    - ``USAGE`` — an argparse usage error (unknown subcommand, bad flag). argparse
      raises ``SystemExit(2)`` before dispatch, so this names its number rather than
      being returned here.
    - ``INTERRUPTED`` — Ctrl+C (SIGINT) escaped ``main()`` outside ``engine.run()``

      SIGINT(2), the shell's conventional code for an interrupt; uncaught this path

      ``main()`` catches it for a clean one-line exit at the same code. The in-run
      interrupt converts to a clean ``RunStopped`` (``engine.py``) and never reaches
      here — a Ctrl+C during a run stays rc 0.

    policy themselves — selects under the persisted choice. Tolerant of a broken
    policy file: diagnostics must keep working on a misconfigured host, and the
    commands that need policy re-load it loudly themselves.

    The registry export belongs *here*, and not at backend construction, for two
    reasons this is the only place that satisfies at once: it is the last point
    that still knows the project (``--project`` has been parsed, no handler has
    run) and it precedes every psmux spawn in the process, the ctl session the
    TUI mints included. Backend construction knows neither — a factory takes no
    arguments, and ``detect_multiplexers`` builds every registered backend for a
    diagnostic table, which must not move a registry as a side effect.
    ``runs.export_psmux_registry_root`` never raises, on the same
    keep-diagnostics-working rule as the policy read above.

    It also *overrides* an ambient ``PSMUX_DATA_DIR`` rather than honouring it —
    the root is derived, always, so that two processes given one project cannot
    disagree about where its sessions live (the full argument is in that
    function). Overriding an operator's variable silently is how someone loses an
    hour to `psmux ls` showing nothing, so it is said once, here, at the only
    point that runs ahead of every command. stderr, not stdout: the ``--json``
    contract is one object on stdout and nothing else, and this is the

    is not a run that should reach `git worktree add`. Neither degrades to "assume
    it's fine", which is the only failure mode that matters for a floor.

    `profiles/*.toml` on its own — the digest via `config_digest`, the adapters via
    `make_adapters` — so a write landing between them stamped a baseline for config
    the run never launched.

    This is NOT the child gate's check-then-use, and must not be read as one: there
    is no comparison here. At launch the on-disk config IS the trust anchor, so an
    adversary who can write in that gap could equally have written BEFORE it and
    been blessed outright, with no timing at all — the race grants no capability.
    The defect runs the other way, toward over-refusal. This pin is the one
    baseline a session cannot reach (`_sweep_factory` holds every later auto-sweep
    to it from MEMORY, unlike resume's disk-backed advisory), so a pin describing
    bytes the run did not launch makes those children refuse the config the parent

    refusal no longer *burns* each trigger (#501: `sweeps_triggered` records only
    a child that started), but that buys nothing here: a wrong pin refuses the next
    trigger exactly as it refused the last.

    `cmd_sweep` deliberately keeps its fresh read: a human started it, and the pin
    it stamps gates no child.

    Same `ProfileError` -> `SystemExit` contract as `_trusted_config_digest`, for

    ``--dry-run`` returns before `_require_base_skills` (cmd_run/cmd_sweep), so a
    project whose skills are broken still gets a plausible-looking preview. Since
    the upstream rename that preview is actively misleading rather than merely
    incomplete: the forwarding shim IS a valid slash command, so a previewed
    ``/bmad-dev-auto`` reads fine and would HALT an unattended session on the
    shim's interactive migration gate.

    Mirrors the refusals the dry-run's early return skips past, and only those:
    the under-floor git `_reject_under_floor_git` refuses first, the finding list
    `_require_base_skills` gates on, the #414 isolation conflict
    `_reject_isolation_conflict` refuses ahead of it, and the unregistered adapter
    kind `make_adapters` aborts on (`_unknown_adapter_kinds` — a preview reads none
    of the fields that would give the misconfiguration away).

    The git floor belongs here for the reason the dirty-tree and queue gates do
    NOT: it is a fact about the HOST, so it cannot come true between this preview
    and the real command the way cleaning a tree can. Both of its arms are
    mirrored — too old, and could not be run at all — because `cmd_run` aborts on
    each, and a banner silent on the second would promise a run guaranteed to
    exit 1. Reading the same
    sources as the gates themselves is what keeps the preview from disagreeing with
    the real command about what "runnable" means. Severity-filtered to `problem`
    for that same reason — `_require_base_skills` ignores warnings, so reporting one
    as a `FAIL:` line would promise an abort that never comes. The dirty-tree, queue
    and run-id gates are deliberately not part of this banner.

    Takes the whole :class:`~bmadconfig.ProjectPaths` rather than `project` alone
    because the #414 refusal is a fact about the two roots' relationship; every
    other probe here still reads `paths.project`, which is what `init` wrote and
    what a session's own root resolution will re-derive.

    The exit code deliberately stays 0. A dry-run is a diagnostic — refusing to
    print the schedule would withhold the very thing the operator asked for, and
    every existing caller reads rc 0 as "the preview rendered", not as "the

    pauses instead of proceeding. This side exists to move the answer earlier —
    the operator learns before the run starts, and learns about *every* gated

    is exactly the thing that goes wrong quietly. That applies to an empty line as
    much as to a malformed token — ``gate: 3-2`` followed by a bare ``gate:`` used
    to report neither, because the entry had tokens and so read as fully gated.

    A fourth cause, and the only one that is about a line the parser never saw: a
    ``gate:`` the strict field anchor misses (``Gate:``, or indented). It is a
    warning rather than an accepted gate on purpose — see :data:`_GATE_NEAR_RE`.

    Runs for every entry that is not ``done``, which is the same set the refusal
    holds against. Keying it on ``open`` instead would have left an entry with an
    unreadable status silent about a malformed token as well as about its gate.

    ``None`` when the queue could not be read, which is not the same answer as an
    empty list: ``queue.sprint-status`` and ``queue.stories-manifest`` own queue
    readability, so this check stays quiet rather than raising — but a caller that
    read ``[]`` as "nothing is gated" would report an all-clear about a queue it
    never saw. The whole walk is inside the guard for the same reason: the
    per-story ``resolve_story_spec`` globs the filesystem too, and leaving it
    outside turned a degraded check into a traceback out of ``validate``.

    Stories mode has no status column — the manifest is a flat schedule and the
    story's own spec carries the status — so actionability comes from
    :func:`stories._classify`, the predicate the scheduler itself picks with.
    Dropping only ``done`` is not the same line the sprint board draws:
    ``ACTIONABLE_STATUSES`` is a two-element allowlist, so ``blocked`` and the
    rest are already out on that side. In stories mode a ``blocked``, sentinel,
    ambiguous or unknown-status entry is one :func:`stories.schedule` refuses to
    dispatch (``SCHEDULE_WEDGED``), so treating every non-``done`` state as
    actionable made ``validate`` exit nonzero over a gate on a story the queue
    could not run — and made the two queue modes disagree about what a gate
    refuses.

    What is shared is that per-entry predicate and deliberately NOT the scan's
    stop rule: ``schedule`` gives up at the FIRST wedged entry, and mirroring that
    here would drop every later story from this list. Two reasons not to. A wedge
    is a property of some *other* story, and ``run --story <id>`` scans that entry
    alone (``selector``), so a later story really is reachable while the wedge
    stands — while ``validate`` takes no story selector and so cannot know which
    run is coming. And stopping would let one blocked entry near the top of a
    manifest silence the gate check for everything below it, which is the failure
    this check exists to prevent, arriving by a quieter route than the one it
    fixed. Over-reporting a real gate on a story that needs an unrelated
    resolution first is the cheaper wrong answer, and dispatch still refuses
    independently.

    At clean close the orchestrator flips each declared id to ``status: done
    <date>`` + a ``resolution:`` line. An id that names no entry — a typo, or an
    entry reworded/renumbered since the spec was written — annotates nothing, and
    the run says so only in the journal, where nobody looks until the retro that
    the annotation exists to spare. Saying it at preflight is the whole point:
    the declaration is fixable before the run, not after.

    Runs in **both** queue modes, because the declaration exists in both. With
    ``spec_folder`` (stories mode) each manifest entry is checked together with
    its id-resolved spec, unioned — the manifest half is what makes this genuinely
    a *pre*-flight, since those ids are readable before the story has ever been
    dispatched. Without it (sprint mode) the story specs already sitting in the
    artifacts dir are scanned instead; those are written by `create-story` ahead
    of the run, which is exactly while a typo is still cheap to fix. Reporting
    only in stories mode left sprint-mode operators with nothing but a journal
    line after the fact.

    An id present but already ``done`` is a declaration a prior run already
    satisfied (a resume re-drives the same close), so it stays silent — the same
    classification the engine's close hook makes, for the same reason. Everything
    else it can journal is reported here: an absent id, an id whose ledger entry
    carries neither an ``open`` nor a ``done`` status (nothing will be marked, and
    the remedy is in the ledger rather than in the declaration), and a
    wrong-container declaration, which names real intent that would otherwise
    close nothing and say nothing. Covering only two of the three left the third
    to be discovered in the journal after the run it should have preceded.

    Never a failure. The annotation is traceability, not a gate, so a stale
    reference must not be able to block a run that would otherwise start.

    Named for the re-arm, not for the stale restore: it began as a `stale-restore-*`
    echo and now carries the baseline family too, so a name from the narrower era

    The baseline records are echoed because a failed advance means the re-drive
    rebuilds against the tree as it stood BEFORE the resolve, and the re-stamp then
    deliberately refuses to write a sha it did not earn. All of it is warn-only by

    repo and it does not change any gate. The park entry is dropped LAST, so
    anything that raises before it leaves the story findable and the command
    re-runnable — see `ParkedStory.resumable` for the state that leaves behind.

    A repeat between the section and the status write is the one case that does
    NOT round-trip cleanly: `append_operator_confirmation` accumulates rather than
    no-ops (a genuinely repeated confirmation — a spec reverted to the park status
    and signed off again — is a real event the audit trail must not lose), so a
    re-run after a failure *here* appends a second section for one event. That is
    a known gap, not the deliberate case the writer's docstring describes.

    It is not only a crash window either: the refusals below both END by asking
    for exactly that re-run, so the duplicate is the ORDINARY outcome of taking
    their advice. Both therefore say so — an unmentioned second sign-off in an
    audit trail is worse than a mentioned one, and the human is the only one who
    can decide whether the first record should stay.

    Repair-write doctrine: these writes RAISE rather than degrade, and this
    asserts the resulting STATE rather than trusting a return value. `confirm` is
    about to declare a story finished; a skipped write it did not notice would
    make it declare that falsely. The commit alone is best-effort — the files are

    Silent on the normal path — the list is empty on every platform without a
    registry namespace and on every machine that never ran the pre-registry
    build. When it is not empty, saying nothing would be the failure: cleanup
    prints a removal count, and a count that quietly excludes sessions it chose
    not to migrate reads as "everything is clean". stderr rather than stdout, the
    `unverifiable_pid` precedent, so `cleanup > log` keeps the receipt; in
    `--json` mode this lives in the document instead and stderr stays empty.

    **One line per registry, naming it.** There is more than one legacy registry
    now — psmux's default, and any root this process displaced — and the
    operator's next action is to open the one holding these sessions. A message
    that named the default for all of them sent the reader to a registry the
    sessions are not in, and at documentation about a registry that is not
    theirs. `runs.legacy_registry_leftovers` maps names to registries so this
    does not have to guess, and omits a registry that holds nothing so no line
    here points somewhere empty.

    Points at the docs rather than printing a command. One of the things named
    here is the machine-wide control session, and `psmux kill-session` on it kills
    every child process in every one of its windows — including, on this
    backend, a window still running an engine (the parked wrapper runs the
    command first and parks only after it exits). A remedy this prints has to be
    safe to run at the moment it is printed; that one is not, so the care lives

    bmad_loop_hook.py <Event>``), so no installed hook reaches this handler today;
    it is the target #461 Phase 2 retargets those registrations to, and that move

    which must be retargeted rather than dropped in the same change. Said here
    because a console script that exists and is documented reads as the live path,
    and an operator debugging a lost Stop needs to know which relay actually ran.

    Total by contract, unlike every other handler: a coding CLI runs this INSIDE
    the session whose completion it reports, and several of them surface a
    non-zero hook exit as a failed tool call in that session. So nothing here
    escalates. :func:`events.relay` already swallows the relay-level failures
    (unset env, garbage stdin, a hostile events dir); the backstop below covers
    the rest — an unexpected exception is a bug in this file, and a bug must not
    be the reason a run's Stop signal turns into a broken session. It reports on
    stderr, never stdout: hook stdout is parsed by the host.

    Dispatched from ``main()`` BEFORE its shared ``try``/``except`` on purpose —
