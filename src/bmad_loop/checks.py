"""Findings — the structured form of what ``bmad-loop validate`` reports.

``validate`` accumulated two lists of prose strings, printed one as ``  ok:`` and
the other as ``FAIL:``. That made the *outcome* addressable (the exit code) but
not the *checks*: a script wanting to branch on "hooks aren't registered" had to
match remediation sentences, which are the part most likely to be reworded. A
:class:`Finding` pairs each printed line with a stable ``check`` id, so the id is
the matchable identity and the message stays free to change.

This lives in its own module rather than in ``cli`` or ``machine``:

- ``cli`` imports ``install``, and ``install`` must *return* Findings — putting
  the type in ``cli`` would make that a cycle.
- ``machine`` is deliberately narrow: transport for the ``--json`` contract, zero
  domain knowledge. Severity is a concept no other ``--json`` command has.

:data:`VALIDATE_CHECKS` is the registry every id must be in, enforced by an
assert in :meth:`ValidationReport.add`. That is what keeps "one printed line =
exactly one Finding" true: a new check site cannot ship without first naming
itself here. The assert only ever fires on a literal an author just wrote, never
on runtime data, so it is a lint with a stack trace rather than a validation.

# Strict-checked under #245 Stage 2, with one rule relaxed for this file only:
# `ValidationReport.findings` uses the idiomatic `field(default_factory=list)`,
# which pyright can only infer as `list[Unknown]` (it does not fold the declared
# `list[Finding]` annotation back into the bare `list` factory) though the field
# is correctly typed. Every other strict rule stays on.
