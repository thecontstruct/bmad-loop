    # copies the entire repo into the worktree, gitignored and untracked files
    # included. And because a worktree mounts UNDER the repo (.bmad-loop/runs/...),

    # before the path length failed, silently, since the seed copy suppresses errors.

    # untracked secret.env in and self-recursed until the path length failed, with
    # provision_worktree returning no skip at all.

    # The "/" it then renders is INERT, not a blanket exclusion — git strips a bare
    # slash to a zero-length pattern that matches nothing (worktree_flow.py says the
    # same at the write side). That is what makes this worth guarding rather than

    # `git add -A` stages the main checkout's untracked files into the story.
