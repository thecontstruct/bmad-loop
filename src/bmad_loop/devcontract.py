"""Translate the generic `bmad-build-auto` skill's output into the orchestrator's
result.json contract.

Alex Verhovsky's upstream `bmad-build-auto` skill (BMAD-METHOD PR #2500) is a
decoupled autonomous-coding primitive: it writes NO result.json. Its outcome
lives in the spec it produced — `status:` in the frontmatter (the machine-
consumable signal) plus an appended `## Auto Run Result` prose section (intended
for an LLM deciding how to handle failure). This module is the thin Python shim
that turns that on-disk spec into the legacy result dict that verify.py /
escalation.py already consume, so the rest of the pipeline stays unchanged.

DOCTRINE — never trust prose for a gate. The frontmatter `status:` read straight
off disk is authoritative; the `## Auto Run Result` prose is only used to route
the blocked→PAUSE decision and to carry a human-readable detail. Where the two
disagree we surface it (`status_consistent=False`) so the caller can fail safe
(treat a mismatch as a retry rather than silently proceeding). Every real
deterministic gate (git baseline, worktree-changed, sprint advancement, dw_id
match) still runs in verify.py against actual on-disk state.

    verbatim (``atomic_write_bytes``, not the text sibling): every caller here has
    already captured and preserved the file's own line endings, and text mode's
    ``newline=None`` default would re-translate ``\\n``→``\\r\\n`` on Windows. The
    temp ends in ``.tmp`` (not ``.md``), so the ``*.md`` artifact scans never see

    callers impose best-effort, the writer never swallows.

    Now a thin name over `platform_util`'s atomic byte writers (#379) rather than
    a hand-rolled temp: same shape, plus an fsync before the replace and a temp
    name unique per write instead of a fixed ``<spec>.md.tmp`` two concurrent

    through the anchored, component-walked helper; a spec in an artifacts folder
    configured outside the checkout keeps the plain ``follow_symlinks=False``
    write. That no-follow keeps the name-replacing semantics the `atomic_replace`
    here always had — the spec path comes from a session-driven scan, so writing
    THROUGH a planted link would hand that session a host-side write wherever it
    chose — and the confined arm needs no flag, because it never follows
    anything. ``require_writable_target=True`` on both arms restores the
    `PermissionError` an operator's read-only spec used to earn (#597).

    ``confine_root`` is a REQUIRED keyword here and on all four public writers
    that reach this one, so a caller that has not decided which checkout the spec
    belongs to is a pyright error rather than an unconfined write. The two

    a marker-less terminal spec sits in `find_frontmatter_candidates`' territory
    (it requires ZERO real headings); after it the spec carries exactly one real
    ``## Auto Run Result`` heading and moves into `find_result_artifact`'s

    doctrine `strip_auto_run_result` and `reset_spec_status` share — the CALLER

    Newline handling follows `reset_spec_status`'s intent: the file's line ending
    is detected (CRLF vs LF) and reused for the appended block, and a missing
    trailing newline is added so the heading can never glue onto the last body line
    (``...body## Auto Run Result``). The spec is read as raw bytes rather than via
    `read_text`, whose universal-newline translation would both hide a CRLF file's
    ending and silently rewrite its whole body to LF — an in-place repair must not
    mutate line endings it did not author. The section is ``## Auto Run Result`` /
    blank / ``Status: <status>`` / blank / the provenance note (plus an optional
