"""Cross-platform process primitives.

The pid kill/liveness primitives now live behind the :class:`~bmad_loop.process_host.ProcessHost`
seam; ``terminate_pid``/``pid_alive`` remain here as thin back-compat shims that
delegate to it. ``detach_kwargs`` stays a real implementation — it is spawn
configuration, not a process-lifecycle primitive, so it does not belong on the
host. On Linux/macOS — and WSL, which *is* Linux — these preserve today's exact
behavior. The file-replace and segment helpers below (``atomic_replace``,
``atomic_write_text``, ``atomic_write_bytes``, ``safe_segment``,
``safe_ref_segment``) are exercised by the platform tests; the pid kill/liveness
Windows branch degrades gracefully and is not yet exercised.

``safe_segment`` and ``safe_ref_segment`` share a contract but not a rule set: the
first coerces a Windows *filename* segment, the second a *git ref* component, and
neither alphabet contains the other (``CON`` is a legal ref and an illegal filename;
``a..b`` is the reverse). Consumers that derive both a directory and a branch from
the same key must run both.

    The third member of the "must be a path inside the project" family, and the
    one a `not value` emptiness check misses. It exists because these guards feed
    `provision_worktree`'s seed loop, where a root-naming entry resolves ``src``
    to the repo root and ``dst`` to the worktree, both of which pass the loop's
    ``is_relative_to`` containment checks — a path is relative to itself. Measured:
    ``""`` and ``"."`` produce a byte-identical ``(src, raw, dst)`` triple there,
    so a guard rejecting only the first is a guard against one spelling.

    Both flavours are checked for the same reason :func:`is_absolute_path` checks
    both: ``".\\"`` is a root ref Windows normalizes away and POSIX parsing keeps
    as an ordinary one-segment name. Pair with the other two for a complete
    "must stay inside the project, and must name something in it" guard.

    The dot/space spellings are the same asymmetry one layer down. Win32 path
    normalization strips *every* trailing period and space from a path's final
    component, so ``". "``, ``".. "``, ``"..."`` and even ``"   "`` all name the
    containing directory there, while both pure flavours keep them as ordinary
    one-segment names (pathlib never applies that trim — only ``resolve()``, by
    asking the OS, does). A component made solely of periods and spaces is
    therefore root-naming, and that is where *this* predicate's rule stops:
    ``"foo. "`` strips to ``"foo"``, names a child, and is accepted here. It is
    still refused, by :func:`names_win32_alias`, on the ground this predicate does
    not speak to: the trim leaves ``"foo. "`` inside the tree, so containment has
    nothing to object to, but it does not name the same path on Windows as it does
    on POSIX, and that determinism rule is the fourth member's.

    ``".. "`` lands here rather than in :func:`has_parent_ref` because the trailing
    space stops it matching the ``..`` relative component, so Win32 trims it to
    empty instead of climbing — it names the root, not the parent. That reading is
    Wine's conformance suite and Project Zero's write-up; Microsoft's own docs are
    ambiguous on the trim-vs-relative-component ordering. Nothing rests on
    resolving it: under the other reading ``".. "`` escapes the tree, and the

    Win32 trims away before the path ever reaches the filesystem.

    The fourth member of the "must be a path inside the project" family, and the
    only one about *determinism* rather than containment. The other three refuse a
    value that leaves the tree; this one refuses a value that stays inside it and
    still names a *different* path on Windows than it does on POSIX.
    ``skill_tree = "NUL"`` is project-relative by every measure the other three
    apply, and on Windows it is a device rather than a directory. Two rules, both
    applied per component — both separators are split for the same reason
    :func:`names_tree_root` splits both.

    **Rule 1 — reserved device basenames.** ``_RESERVED_BASENAMES`` holds ``CON``,
    ``PRN``, ``AUX``, ``NUL``, the console pair ``CONIN$``/``CONOUT$``, ``COM0``
    through ``COM9``, ``LPT0`` through ``LPT9``, and the ISO-8859-1 superscript
    ``COM¹``/``COM²``/``COM³`` and ``LPT¹``/``LPT²``/``LPT³`` forms.
    :func:`_is_reserved_basename` compares case-insensitively, with or without an
    extension, and trims trailing spaces before comparing — ``nul``, ``NUL.txt``
    and ``CON .txt`` all count, and the trim-first ordering is right because Win32
    strips the trailing run *before* it tests for a device (``aux.. ..`` resolves
    to AUX). It is a *segment* predicate: it splits on the first dot of the whole
    string, so ``_is_reserved_basename("sub/NUL")`` is False. Applying it per
    component is what puts ``"sub/NUL"`` in reach at all.

    That set is deliberately a superset of Microsoft's published list, which names
    only ``COM1``-``COM9`` and ``LPT1``-``LPT9`` and omits the console pair
    entirely — Wine's ``RtlIsDosDeviceName_U`` matches ``CONIN$``/``CONOUT$`` and
    rejects the ``0`` forms, so ``COM0``/``LPT0`` are refused here by neither
    authority. Over-refusing six spellings nobody wants as a directory name is the
    safe direction for a guard; do not read the set as a claim about Win32.

    Windows 11 narrowed the rule the set encodes. Microsoft states the change (in
    the .NET path-format documentation, not in the file-naming page, which still
    asserts the old model): before Windows 11 a path *beginning* with a legacy
    device name was always interpreted as that device, so ``CON.TXT`` meant
    ``\\\\.\\CON``; that no longer applies. Wine's conformance data encodes the
    same narrowing case by case — ``C:\\con\\con`` carries a Windows 11 alternate
    expectation of a literal path, and the extension forms are marked as failing
    there — while bare ``NUL`` is left unmarked at every position. Bare ``NUL`` at
    a leaf therefore stays a device on Windows 11, as though every existing
    directory holds a virtual ``NUL``; ``sub/CON`` and ``NUL.txt`` do not. The
    unnarrowed rule — hijack from any position, extension or not — holds on
    Windows 10 and earlier.

    We refuse the Windows 10 superset on every platform anyway, deliberately: a
    config value must not mean one thing on one OS build and something else on the
    next, and a guard that tracked the narrowing would turn a ``seed_files`` entry
    into a build-number question. It is the same reasoning that already has the
    family refusing ``C:\\secrets`` on POSIX.

    **Rule 2 — the trailing period/space trim.** Win32 removes every trailing
    period and space from a path component, so ``".claude/skills."`` creates and
    addresses ``.claude/skills`` while the configured string still spells
    ``skills.``. The divergence reaches past the filesystem: git's gitignore parser
    reads the authored spelling, so a shield pattern rendered from the config
    matches ``skills.`` and misses the directory Win32 actually made.

    Rule 2 reads the same trim :func:`names_tree_root` does, split by what the
    whole *value* amounts to rather than by component. That predicate owns a value
    made *entirely* of period/space components, where the trim leaves nothing at
    any level and the value names the tree root. This one owns everything else the
    trim touches: a component the trim shortens (``"skills. "`` names a sibling of
    what was written) and equally a component the trim *empties* when it sits
    beside a real one — ``"sub/..."`` is nobody's root and nobody's parent, so it
    is an alias and belongs here (it addresses ``sub`` on Windows and a literal
    ``...`` directory on POSIX; the first review round caught it slipping all four
    members). The ``not root_naming`` term draws that line, and the
    ``part not in (".", "..")`` carve-out beside it hands the two spellings that
    mean the *same* path on every platform back to their owners — ``"."`` is a
    no-op component everywhere, ``".."`` is :func:`has_parent_ref`'s climb. All
    four members therefore refuse disjoint spelling classes — which is what lets
    each be ablated on its own, and mirrors :func:`names_tree_root`'s own
    ``part != ".."`` carve-out one function up.

    The git half of rule 2 is measured, on this repo's own suite. **The Win32
    filesystem half is cited, not measured** — this is a Linux box and nothing here
    calls a Win32 API. The sources are Microsoft's "Naming Files, Paths, and
    Namespaces" for the reserved list and the ``NUL.txt`` equivalence; Microsoft's
    ".NET File path formats on Windows systems" for the trim rule and the Windows
    11 statement; Wine's ntdll path conformance tests (``test_RtlGetFullPathName_U``
    and ``test_RtlIsDosDeviceName_U``, against ``collapse_path`` and
    ``RtlIsDosDeviceName_U``) for the per-case narrowing and the ``NUL`` carve-out;
    and Project Zero's "The Definitive Guide on Win32 to NT Path Conversion" (2016,
    so pre-narrowing) for the mechanism. The ``NUL`` carve-out is stated by none of
    Microsoft's pages."""

    bridge — ``\\\\wsl.localhost\\<distro>\\...`` or its legacy ``\\\\wsl$\\<distro>\\...``
    spelling, matched case-insensitively and with either separator, since Windows
    accepts ``//wsl$/...`` as readily as the backslash form.

    Used to spot a native-Windows interpreter working a distro path — the #332
    mis-pick, where WSL's appended Windows ``PATH`` lands a bash prompt on a ``win32``
    build that takes the win32 defaults and never sees the distro's tmux.

    The path is the signal because the obvious alternative does not survive: probed on
    a live interop launch (Windows 11, WSL2, Ubuntu-24.04, 2026-08), ``WSL_DISTRO_NAME``
    and ``WSL_INTEROP`` were absent from the child and ``PWD``, when present at all,
    carried the *Windows*-side parent's value rather than the distro cwd — WSL hands a
    Windows binary the *Windows* environment block. So an env marker is not merely
    missing, it can be present and wrong. Nothing pins that observation, so re-probe
    before adding an env-marker check rather than assuming one would work.

    Platform-blind by design (reads no ``sys.platform``): the "is this interpreter the
    wrong one" half stays at the call site.

    Callers pass a resolved path (``cli._project``), and resolution is what decides the
    coverage: measured on Windows 11 / CPython 3.13, ``Path.resolve()`` leaves both
    bridge spellings untouched, folds ``//wsl.localhost/...`` into the backslash form,
    and dereferences a mapped drive or ``subst`` alias back to the UNC spelling — so all
    of those match. An extended-length ``\\\\?\\UNC\\...`` prefix the input already
    carried (``ntpath.realpath`` only strips one it added itself) is folded down to the
    plain UNC form here, so that spelling matches too. A spelling this still misses
    degrades gracefully: the ``mux.selection`` line names the platform regardless.

    One caller now passes an *un*resolved path: when the OS refuses to canonicalize,
    :func:`resolve_or_lexical` degrades to ``absolute()``, which is the only way this
    check runs at all on the host it is for (#552). All four bridge spellings still
    match — they are already absolute — but the mapped-drive/``subst`` dereference is
    gone, so a substituted drive letter over a *dead* provider goes unflagged. That is
    the graceful-degradation case above, not a new one: the finding is a warning, and
    ``mux.selection`` still names the platform."""

    """``Path(path).resolve()``, degrading to a *lexical* absolutization — and one
    note on stderr — when the OS refuses to canonicalize the path (#552).

    The condition this exists for: on a Windows host whose WSL UNC provider is
    registered but not serving, resolving ``\\\\wsl$\\<distro>\\...`` raises
    ``ERROR_NETNAME_DELETED`` (WinError 64). CPython's non-strict
    ``ntpath._getfinalpathname_nonstrict`` re-raises any winerror outside its
    allow-list, and 64 is not on it, so ``resolve()`` fails outright rather than
    falling back to its own lexical walk. Reached from ``cli._project`` before
    dispatch, that killed *every* subcommand at ``main()``'s backstop — including
    ``diagnose`` and ``validate``, whose ``host.win32-on-wsl-path`` finding names
    that exact host. The warning was unreachable on the only hosts it is for.

    ``RuntimeError`` is caught alongside ``OSError`` because ``resolve()`` raises it,
    not an ``OSError``, for a symlink loop on the 3.11/3.12 floor — the asymmetry
    ``install._shield_undo_extension`` documents; the pair is this repo's house guard,
    applied at 17-odd sites already.

    **Degrade, not fail** — deliberately, and bounded. The fallback is exactly
    ``Path(path).absolute()``: absolute, nothing else. It is enough for the
    observation surface, because :func:`is_wsl_unc_path` is purely lexical and every
    bridge spelling is already absolute, so ``absolute()`` hands it back untouched
    (pathlib folds ``//wsl.localhost/...`` to the backslash form on the way). It is
    *not* canonical, so this helper stays at the observation surface —
    ``cli._project``, which runs pre-dispatch where there is no handler to catch
    anything, and ``bmadconfig.worktree_isolation_conflict``'s comparison, which must
    not kill ``validate`` ahead of the platform preflight. ``bmadconfig.load_paths``
    is the boundary and refuses instead — a typed ``BmadConfigError`` for the project
    root *and* every configured path: a spelling the OS cannot canonicalize has an
    unknowable location (it can sit lexically inside the project while an in-tree
    junction carries it to a dead share outside), and classifying it by its spelling
    is a guess that can redirect a worktree-isolated run's writes. The write paths
    that need a canonical answer keep their bare ``resolve()`` and still raise:
    ``runs.project_tag`` digests ``str(project.resolve())`` into a session-ownership
    tag, and two spellings of one project would strand live sessions. So a ``run`` on
    such a host fails loud at config load, while ``validate``/``diagnose`` still
    reach the finding that explains it — observation degrades, repair writes raise.

    **Rejected: ``normpath(absolute(path))``.** Collapsing ``..`` lexically is not a
    respelling, it names a *different directory* whenever the ``..`` crosses a
    symlink — measured, not reasoned: with ``/home/u/link -> /var/x``,
    ``/home/u/link/../proj`` opens ``/var/proj``, and normpath yields
    ``/home/u/proj``. The raw value reaching here is persisted as ``state.project``
    and reused as a git repo root and a session cwd (``runsetup.build_run_state``,
    ``runs``, ``resolve``), so that would be a silent wrong-directory write — a
    failure class ``resolve()`` never had, introduced by the guard meant to soften
    it. Plain ``absolute()`` keeps the ``..`` and lets the OS dereference it
    correctly at every use, which is the whole reason to prefer it over a
    prettier-looking string.

    A relative ``path`` with an unreadable cwd still raises out of ``absolute()``:
    there is no lexical answer to degrade to, and the backstop is the honest reply."""

    ``os.replace`` swaps a *new inode* into place, so a naive tmp-write-and-replace
    quietly resets everything carried by the old file rather than by its name. This
    restores the parts that matter:

    * **Symlinks are followed.** ``path.resolve()`` first, so a ledger symlinked
      into the repo keeps being a symlink and the real file is what gets rewritten
      — a replace against the link itself would turn it into a regular file and
      orphan the target. Pass ``follow_symlinks=False`` to invert that: the name
      is replaced, whatever it points at. Right for a machine-minted file living
      somewhere a less-trusted writer can reach, where honouring a planted link
      would aim this write at a path of that writer's choosing; wrong for the
      operator-curated ledgers this helper was built for, hence the default.
    * **Permission bits survive.** A ``0600`` file stays ``0600`` instead of
      becoming ``0644 & ~umask``, which on a shared artifact dir is the difference
      between "the group can still write this" and a silent lockout (or a
      disclosure).
    * **Extended attributes survive** where the platform has them (best effort).

    Ownership is NOT preserved — an unprivileged process cannot chown — so a file
    written by another user changes hands. Callers writing genuinely shared,
    multi-user state need more than this helper. A target that does not exist yet
    is created with ``mkstemp``'s private ``0600``, not the umask default: there is
    no prior mode to carry over, and the restrictive choice is the safe one.

    The temp file is uniquely named in the target's own directory: same filesystem
    (``os.replace`` cannot cross one), and no fixed ``.tmp`` sibling for a
    concurrent writer of the same file to collide with. A failure anywhere leaves
    the original untouched and removes the temp.

    The contents are **fsynced before the replace publishes them**. Closing a file
    only hands the data to the page cache, so a machine that loses power just
    after the rename can come back with the new name pointing at blocks that were
    never written — a zero-length or torn ledger, which parses as *no entries* and
    so reads as the whole file's worth of hand-written work having vanished.
    Ordering the flush before the rename means a crash yields either the old file
    or the complete new one. The directory itself is deliberately not synced: that
    would make the *rename* durable, and losing the rename just leaves the old
    contents in place — stale, never corrupt.

    ``require_writable_target=True`` refuses the write when the target already
    exists and the kernel will not open it for writing — the property a
    temp-and-replace write otherwise loses, because ``os.replace`` needs write
    permission on the *directory* and never opens the entry it replaces (#597).
    Off by default: that is the behavior every caller has today, and turning it on
    for all of them would refuse writes that currently succeed. See
    :func:`_refuse_unwritable_target` for what the probe does and does not promise.

    The bytes sibling is :func:`atomic_write_bytes`; the two share every property
    above and differ only in the ``os.fdopen`` mode. Text mode's *newline*
    default (translating) is deliberate here — it matches the ``Path.write_text``
    this replaced, so a ledger's line endings do not change under Windows."""

    ``follow_symlinks`` behaves exactly as it does there. The default resolves
    ``path`` first, so a file symlinked into the repo keeps being a symlink and

    round trip. Callers handling filesystem-derived content want this variant — a

    rather than the target's extension, which `devcontract._atomic_write_spec`
    depends on to keep its temps out of the ``*.md`` artifact scans.

    ``mkstemp`` inserts 8 random characters between prefix and suffix, so the temp
    name runs ``len(target.name) + 13``. A basename within 13 bytes of the
    filesystem's ``NAME_MAX`` therefore makes the TEMP name illegal at a path the
    target itself is perfectly legal at. Measured on ext4 (``NAME_MAX`` 255): a
    242-byte basename stages fine, 243 raises ``ENAMETOOLONG`` while the direct
    write it replaced succeeded through 255 (#595).

    The fallback replaces the readable prefix with a digest of it rather than
    truncating it. Truncation is the obvious fix and it is wrong: ``NAME_MAX``
    counts BYTES while Python slices CHARACTERS, so a bounded character slice
    neither guarantees a legal name nor avoids splitting a UTF-8 sequence — and
    the limit is not portably knowable anyway (``os.pathconf`` is POSIX-only,
    NTFS counts UTF-16 code units, and win32 is usually bound by ``MAX_PATH`` on
    the whole path instead). Letting the OS answer needs none of that arithmetic:
    the common path keeps the readable name, and only a basename that cannot fit
    degrades to a fixed-width digest.

    ``os.fsencode``, not ``str.encode``: a POSIX filename is arbitrary bytes and
    may carry surrogates that a strict UTF-8 encode would raise on.

    The retry keys on TWO spellings of one condition, because win32 does not use
    the POSIX one: ``ERROR_FILENAME_EXCED_RANGE`` arrives as ``ENOENT`` and is
    distinguishable only by ``.winerror`` (see
    ``_WINERROR_FILENAME_EXCED_RANGE``). Keying on ``ENAMETOOLONG`` alone left
    this whole fallback dead on Windows — where, per the ``MAX_PATH`` note above,
    it is if anything easier to reach than on ext4.

    The rungs STRICTLY SHORTEN, and the last one carries no prefix at all. A
    digest is 16 characters, so on its own it is not a fallback — against a
    basename of 16 or fewer it stages a name no shorter than the one that just
    failed, and retrying at the same width cannot succeed. That is unreachable
    where the binding limit is per-component (a POSIX ``NAME_MAX`` rung is only
    reached past 242 characters, far above the digest) and reachable where it is
    the whole path, which is the win32 case: a short basename in a directory near
    ``MAX_PATH`` overflows on the staging suffix alone. So the digest rung is used
    only while it actually shortens, and a bare ``mkstemp`` — the shortest name
    this function can produce — always ends the ladder.

    Only a failure at that last rung propagates. No choice of *prefix* can fix
    that one — there is no prefix left — but that is a narrower statement than "the
    directory is too long", and the difference is #596: ``mkstemp`` will not
    generate a name below 12 characters (8 random, plus the ``.tmp`` this helper
    needs to stay out of ``devcontract``'s ``*.md`` scans). What does not fit at
    the last rung is therefore the directory PLUS those 12, which a target with a
    shorter basename can still clear on a direct write. Shrinking below the floor
    means abandoning ``mkstemp``, and with it the entropy that keeps the staged
    name unpredictable where a less-trusted writer can reach it — see #591 for the
    cost of a guessable temp name."""

    """Re-raise the kernel's own ``PermissionError`` when ``target`` exists and
    will not open for writing — the opt-in half of ``require_writable_target``.

    A temp-and-replace write never opens the file it replaces, and ``os.replace``
    needs write permission on the *directory*, not on the entry being replaced. So
    a file an operator marked ``0444`` is overwritten anyway — and where mode is
    inherited (``follow_symlinks=True``) it comes back reading ``0444``, with
    nothing in the permission bits recording that it changed. Every writer here
    that once spelled ``Path.write_text`` refused that write as a side effect of
    opening the file; going atomic dropped the refusal silently (#597). This asks
    for it back, per caller, over the files an operator actually curates.

    An actual ``os.open``, not ``os.access``: access(2) answers for the REAL uid
    and only approximates ACLs, while the open is the kernel's answer under the
    same credentials the write will use, and reproduces the exact error the direct
    write used to raise. On win32 a READONLY file denies ``O_WRONLY`` with
    ``ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED``, which arrives as ``PermissionError``, so this arm is
    real on both platforms rather than POSIX-only.

    Three cases are deliberately NOT refusals, and all three simply return:

    * **A missing target.** There is nothing to refuse — the write creates it, and
      creation is what the flagged callers do on first run.
    * **``ELOOP``**, i.e. a symlink at the name on the no-follow path. That write
      replaces the NAME whatever it points at, on purpose, and a plantable link's
      target mode is the planter's choice as much as anyone's (see
      :func:`_atomic_write`). Win32 has no ``O_NOFOLLOW`` to raise ``ELOOP`` with,
      so the same case is caught there by the :func:`is_link_like` pre-check below.
    * **Any other ``OSError``** — a directory at the name, a full disk, a
      disconnected share. Refusing here would replace the write's own, more
      accurate error with a permission story that is not what happened.

    ``O_NONBLOCK`` is what keeps the third case reachable for a FIFO. Opening a
    reader-less FIFO ``O_WRONLY`` does not fail — it WAITS for a reader that a
    planted FIFO will never have, wedging the probe (and the loop driving it)
    forever, and ``O_NOFOLLOW`` is no help because a FIFO is not a symlink.
    Non-blocking turns that wait into ``ENXIO``, which the third case returns on,
    and the write then replaces the FIFO's name like any other. For the regular
    files this probe exists for the flag changes nothing: POSIX gives it no
    effect on a regular-file open or on the permission check, and win32 — which
    has no ``O_NONBLOCK`` — has no path-visible FIFOs to block on either.

    This honours an operator's stated intent; it is NOT a boundary against a
    same-uid writer. The answer is stale the moment it returns — a ``chmod``
    between probe and replace still lands the write — and whoever can chmod the
    file back can defeat it outright. :func:`_atomic_write` runs it BEFORE

    both variants at once (tests/test_install.py's #375 case).

    ``follow_symlinks=False`` skips the resolve, so the *name* is what gets
    replaced. It needs no preflight ``is_symlink`` check to be safe, and that is
    the reason to prefer it over one: ``os.replace`` does not dereference its
    destination, so a link planted at any moment — including between a check and
    this call — is overwritten rather than written through.

    Mode and xattrs are then not inherited **at all**, and nothing is probed to
    decide that. A name being replaced rather than updated should carry nothing
    of whatever it used to point at, and in this mode there is no trustworthy
    prior to carry over anyway: the caller asked for no-follow precisely because
    a less-trusted writer can reach the name, so the mode found there is that

    NAME and is stale the moment it returns, so it removes the standing redirect
    — plant a link, wait for a write — while a writer who re-plants inside the
    window between check and write still wins. That residual is the platform's,
    not this function's: win32 has no ``*at()`` family to anchor against.

    Every component below ``root`` is checked and ``root`` itself is not: the
    operator chooses where the project lives and may well keep it behind a link,
    while everything under it is session-writable. That is the same split
    :func:`open_dir_confined` makes by opening ``root`` without ``O_NOFOLLOW``.

    ``lstat``-based throughout, so the walk never resolves through the thing it
    is testing for — and an ``lstat`` that RAISES answers False, because a
    component that cannot be probed is one this cannot vouch for. ``Path``'s own
    predicates swallow that error and answer "not a link", which walks PAST the
    component instead: the opposite of what a confinement check owes its caller.

    Both link kinds count. ``S_ISLNK`` is the whole answer on POSIX; on win32 a
    DIRECTORY JUNCTION redirects identically, is invisible to ``is_symlink()``,
    and is the cheaper plant (``mklink /J`` needs neither elevation nor Developer
    Mode). Recognised through :data:`_LINK_REPARSE_TAGS` rather than
    ``os.path.isjunction``, which is 3.12+ while this package's floor is 3.11.

    Narrower than ``tui/launch._run_dir_is_confined``, which refuses ANY reparse
    point. Over-refusing is the cheap direction there — the cost is one unwritten
    hint — but this backs writes an operator's own configuration depends on, so a
    OneDrive placeholder or a dedup stub in the ancestry must not turn every
    policy write into a failure.

    Confinement is answered about the LEXICAL spelling handed in, exactly as

    **Non-directory, not regular file** — ``os.walk`` puts FIFOs, device nodes and
    symlinks in ``files`` alongside ordinary ones, and this yields what it is
    handed. A caller that only counts or ``lstat``s is fine; a caller that OPENS
    what it yields owes its own regular-file check, because opening a planted
    FIFO blocks forever. Swapping ``rglob`` for this helper silently drops the
    ``is_file()`` guard the old loop carried — that regression shipped once
    (``diagnostics.summarize_files``, whose ``logs`` arm reads to count lines).

    Two holes, closed together because a caller that measures or counts a tree
    gets both wrong in the same way:

    ``os.walk`` already declines to recurse into a symlinked subdirectory — but
    it decides that with ``os.path.islink``, which is False for a Windows
    DIRECTORY JUNCTION. That is the unprivileged redirect (see
    :func:`is_link_like`), so on win32 the pruning `os.walk` documents is exactly
    the arm an attacker would use. And ``os.walk`` always follows the top path it
    is handed, symlink or not, so refusing to descend into links says nothing
    about the root.

    Both matter to more than tidiness: a session is handed a writable run
    directory (`BMAD_LOOP_RUN_DIR`) and can plant a link at an entry that `clean`
    sizes and `diagnose` counts, which would bill a reclaim estimate — or a
    diagnostic dump — for an arbitrarily large tree outside the run that neither
    command touches. Yields paths; the caller chooses ``stat`` or ``lstat``.

    ``follow_symlinks=False`` stops a link planted at the file itself and nothing
    more: ``mkstemp(dir=...)`` and ``os.replace``'s destination are still ordinary
    path lookups, so a link planted at any DIRECTORY above the target lands both
    the temp and the published file wherever that link points, and the no-follow
    bought nothing (#593). ``mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)`` accepts a
    symlink-to-a-directory, so a planted parent survives the setup step the
    callers run first. This closes that: the parent is established once, and the
    write is aimed at what was established rather than at the name again.

    A separate function rather than a ``confine_root=`` keyword on the plain
    writer. That keyword would admit a combination with no meaning — confined AND
    following symlinks — it would change ``_atomic_write`` for the dozen callers
    who did not ask for it, and separate names keep the adopted cohort greppable.

    ``path`` must be **lexically** under ``confine_root`` (``relative_to``, no
    resolve — the confined spelling is the caller's own construction, and
    resolving it would consult the very links this refuses) **and carry no ``..``
    below it**: ``is_relative_to`` is a prefix test that ``root/specs/../../x``
    passes while naming a path outside the root, and ``..`` is a real directory
    entry the anchored walk would otherwise climb straight back out through
    (``O_NOFOLLOW`` has no opinion on dot-dot). Either refusal raises before
    anything is walked or staged. ``path.parent`` must
    already EXIST: a confinement walk cannot vouch for a component that is not
    there, so every adopter mkdirs or gates first.

    POSIX walks the components with :func:`open_dir_confined` and writes through
    the descriptor that walk produced, which a later swap of any name along the
    way no longer reaches. Win32 has no ``*at()`` family, so it degrades to
    :func:`path_is_confined` plus a no-follow write — check-then-write, which
    removes the standing redirect but leaves the window between the check and the
    write open (the precedent, and the same documented residual, as
    ``tui/launch._record_ctl_window``). Either arm refuses by raising
    :class:`UnconfinedWriteError`, which is an ``OSError``.

    Mode and xattrs are NEVER inherited — the file lands at ``0600``, which is
    exactly what ``follow_symlinks=False`` already gives this cohort, so adopting
    this changes no file's permissions. The anchored arm writes UTF-8 with no
    newline translation (identity on POSIX, where the translating default writes
    ``\n`` unchanged) and the win32 arm keeps :func:`atomic_write_text`'s
    translating default, so on each platform the bytes that land are the ones
    that land today. A caller preserving a file's existing line endings wants
    :func:`atomic_write_bytes_confined`, as it wants the bytes writer today.

    belong to it rather than to this function, and each is worse than it looks:
    widening the mode (from the umask, from ``.git``'s own bits, from a
    ``core.sharedRepository`` read) hands a peer write access to a file this
    process is relying on; falling back to ``O_RDONLY`` when the open fails
    rescues only the modes that happen to grant group read; and unlinking a
    badly-moded lock to recreate it is the actively dangerous one — a lock
    another process currently HOLDS would be replaced by a new inode, ``flock``
    exclusion rides the inode, and both processes would then believe they hold
    it, rebuilding the concurrency bug this lock was added to prevent.

    The explicit ``0o600`` states that policy rather than leaving it to the
    caller's umask, which would make the mode a property of whoever provisioned
    first (measured: umask 022 gives 0o755, umask 077 gives 0o700 — both
    arbitrary). It is a ceiling, not a floor: ``os.open``'s mode is still masked,
    so an unusual umask can only narrow it further, never widen it.

    Same contract as :func:`safe_segment` — identity for clean input, a short digest
    of the raw name appended whenever anything changed, never raises — but git's
    alphabet, not Windows': replaces control chars, space, DEL and ``~^:?*[\\/`` with

    there is itself the fix. A lone ``@`` is coerced to ``_`` even though git only
    forbids it as a whole ref name, so the contract holds for any caller.

    A leading ``-`` is deliberately preserved: it is legal in a ref component, and
    the git porcelain's separate "branch name must not start with ``-``" check reads
    the whole name, which callers always prefix (``bmad-loop/<run_id>/<segment>``).
