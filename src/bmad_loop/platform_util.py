"""Cross-platform process primitives.

The pid kill/liveness primitives now live behind the :class:`~bmad_loop.process_host.ProcessHost`
seam; ``terminate_pid``/``pid_alive`` remain here as thin back-compat shims that
delegate to it. ``detach_kwargs`` stays a real implementation — it is spawn
configuration, not a process-lifecycle primitive, so it does not belong on the
host. On Linux/macOS — and WSL, which *is* Linux — these preserve today's exact
behavior. The file-replace and segment helpers below (``atomic_replace``,
``atomic_write_text``, ``atomic_write_bytes``, ``safe_segment``,
``safe_ref_segment``) are exercised by the platform tests; the pid kill/liveness
Windows branch degrades gracefully and is not yet exercised.

``safe_segment`` and ``safe_ref_segment`` share a contract but not a rule set: the
first coerces a Windows *filename* segment, the second a *git ref* component, and
neither alphabet contains the other (``CON`` is a legal ref and an illegal filename;
``a..b`` is the reverse). Consumers that derive both a directory and a branch from
the same key must run both.

    one a `not value` emptiness check misses. It exists because these guards feed
    `provision_worktree`'s seed loop, where a root-naming entry resolves ``src``
    to the repo root and ``dst`` to the worktree, both of which pass the loop's
    ``is_relative_to`` containment checks — a path is relative to itself. Measured:
    ``""`` and ``"."`` produce a byte-identical ``(src, raw, dst)`` triple there,
    so a guard rejecting only the first is a guard against one spelling.

    Both flavours are checked for the same reason :func:`is_absolute_path` checks
    both: ``".\\"`` is a root ref Windows normalizes away and POSIX parsing keeps
    as an ordinary one-segment name. Pair with the other two for a complete
    "must stay inside the project, and must name something in it" guard.

    The dot/space spellings are the same asymmetry one layer down. Win32 path
    normalization strips *every* trailing period and space from a path's final
    component, so ``". "``, ``".. "``, ``"..."`` and even ``"   "`` all name the
    containing directory there, while both pure flavours keep them as ordinary
    one-segment names (pathlib never applies that trim — only ``resolve()``, by
    asking the OS, does). A component made solely of periods and spaces is
    therefore root-naming, and that is the whole rule: ``"foo. "`` strips to
    ``"foo"``, names a child, and is accepted.

    ``".. "`` lands here rather than in :func:`has_parent_ref` because the trailing
    space stops it matching the ``..`` relative component, so Win32 trims it to
    empty instead of climbing — it names the root, not the parent. That reading is
    Wine's conformance suite and Project Zero's write-up; Microsoft's own docs are
    ambiguous on the trim-vs-relative-component ordering. Nothing rests on
    resolving it: under the other reading ``".. "`` escapes the tree, and the

def atomic_write_text(path: Path, text: str) -> None:

    replacement would otherwise silently discard.

    ``os.replace`` swaps a *new inode* into place, so a naive tmp-write-and-replace
    quietly resets everything carried by the old file rather than by its name. This
    restores the parts that matter:

    * **Symlinks are followed.** ``path.resolve()`` first, so a ledger symlinked
      into the repo keeps being a symlink and the real file is what gets rewritten
      — a replace against the link itself would turn it into a regular file and
      orphan the target.
    * **Permission bits survive.** A ``0600`` file stays ``0600`` instead of
      becoming ``0644 & ~umask``, which on a shared artifact dir is the difference
      between "the group can still write this" and a silent lockout (or a
      disclosure).
    * **Extended attributes survive** where the platform has them (best effort).

    Ownership is NOT preserved — an unprivileged process cannot chown — so a file
    written by another user changes hands. Callers writing genuinely shared,
    multi-user state need more than this helper. A target that does not exist yet
    is created with ``mkstemp``'s private ``0600``, not the umask default: there is
    no prior mode to carry over, and the restrictive choice is the safe one.

    The temp file is uniquely named in the target's own directory: same filesystem
    (``os.replace`` cannot cross one), and no fixed ``.tmp`` sibling for a
    concurrent writer of the same file to collide with. A failure anywhere leaves
    the original untouched and removes the temp.

    The contents are **fsynced before the replace publishes them**. Closing a file
    only hands the data to the page cache, so a machine that loses power just
    after the rename can come back with the new name pointing at blocks that were
    never written — a zero-length or torn ledger, which parses as *no entries* and
    so reads as the whole file's worth of hand-written work having vanished.
    Ordering the flush before the rename means a crash yields either the old file
    or the complete new one. The directory itself is deliberately not synced: that
    would make the *rename* durable, and losing the rename just leaves the old
    contents in place — stale, never corrupt.

    The bytes sibling is :func:`atomic_write_bytes`; the two share every property
    above and differ only in the ``os.fdopen`` mode. Text mode's *newline*
    default (translating) is deliberate here — it matches the ``Path.write_text``
    this replaced, so a ledger's line endings do not change under Windows."""

    replace, temp removed on any failure).

    The one difference is the whole point: ``data`` lands byte-for-byte. No encode
    and no newline translation, so a payload carrying LF keeps LF on Windows and
    bytes that are not valid text in any codec survive the round trip. Callers

    deterministic exclusion probe instead of a sleep-based negative assertion.

    Lock a dedicated sibling file, never data that is swapped via
    :func:`atomic_replace` — the lock rides the open fd's inode, and a replace
    would swap that inode out from under later acquirers. ``fcntl.flock`` on
    POSIX; ``msvcrt.locking`` on Windows, where the blocking mode's built-in
    ~10 s retry bounds the wait and surfaces contention as ``OSError``.

    THE WAIT IS PLATFORM-ASYMMETRIC, and a caller has to decide what that means
    for it: POSIX blocks indefinitely, Windows gives up after ~10 s and raises.
    This docstring used to add "holders only do brief file I/O" — true when the
    only consumers were tests, and falsified by the first production caller
    (``install._worktree_local_exclude``, #384), which holds it across a
    multi-step git transaction of roughly seven ``git`` spawns, each bounded by
    ``[limits] git_timeout_s``. So a Windows acquirer can genuinely time out
    under contention rather than only under a deadlock. Hold it for as short a
    span as correctness allows, and handle the ``OSError`` from acquisition.

    OWNER-ONLY, AND DELIBERATELY NOT MADE TO WORK ACROSS OS USERS. A repository
    shared between OS users is not a supported configuration (maintainer
    decision, #384); ``install._shield_shared_repository`` refuses one up front,
    above the shield's acquisition of this lock, so no lock file is created there
    at all. That gate is where the case is handled — not here. Three "fixes"
    belong to it rather than to this function, and each is worse than it looks:
    widening the mode (from the umask, from ``.git``'s own bits, from a
    ``core.sharedRepository`` read) hands a peer write access to a file this
    process is relying on; falling back to ``O_RDONLY`` when the open fails
    rescues only the modes that happen to grant group read; and unlinking a
    badly-moded lock to recreate it is the actively dangerous one — a lock
    another process currently HOLDS would be replaced by a new inode, ``flock``
    exclusion rides the inode, and both processes would then believe they hold
    it, rebuilding the concurrency bug this lock was added to prevent.

    The explicit ``0o600`` states that policy rather than leaving it to the
    caller's umask, which would make the mode a property of whoever provisioned
    first (measured: umask 022 gives 0o755, umask 077 gives 0o700 — both
    arbitrary). It is a ceiling, not a floor: ``os.open``'s mode is still masked,
