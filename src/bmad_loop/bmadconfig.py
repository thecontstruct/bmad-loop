    """The refusal message for ``isolation = "worktree"`` under a `repo_root`
    override, or None when the combination is supported (#414).

    Worktree provisioning reads ``repo_root`` for every surface it seeds *off disk*
    — the upstream skill trees, `_bmad/` and the `_bmad/custom/` overrides inside
    it, and each `seed_files`/`seed_globs` entry — and bakes the absolute hook-relay
    path from it into the worktree's hook config, while `init`, `validate` and the
    run preflight write and probe those same surfaces under ``project``. (The relay
    itself is pointed at, never copied. The `MODULE_SKILLS` this wheel bundles are
    seeded from package data and are unaffected by either root; nothing is seeded
    from ``project``, which `provision_worktree` is never even passed.)
    `load_paths` *requires* `project/_bmad/bmm/config.yaml`, so `_bmad/` is under
    `project` by definition and `repo_root/_bmad/` generally does not exist. When
    the two diverge the preflight therefore approves a surface the isolated run
    never receives, and the seed-completeness gates go inert rather than fire: an
    isolated session dispatches into a worktree with no dev primitive and no
    renderer, and stops with no result and nothing journaled naming the cause.

    **This function exists to be deleted.** The real fix is #443 — plumb ``project``
    through provisioning for the non-git reads — and landing it removes this
    function, all five of its call sites, the `policy.isolation-repo-root` id and
    both doc sentences. It is a refusal rather than the fix because "which root
    wins" is a separate decision per seeded surface (the relay only exists under
    `project`; operator-configured `seed_files` may legitimately name a path outside
    it), and `ProjectPaths.rebased` encodes `project == repo_root` besides. So the
    message names only remediations that exist today. Both are named because either
    alone is sufficient and which one is right is the operator's call: the override
    buys a decoupled git root, the isolation mode buys per-unit worktrees, and until
    #443 lands the orchestrator cannot give both.

    Sole producer of the text, shared by `cmd_validate`, the run/sweep preflight,
    the dry-run honesty banner and the TUI's pre-launch guard, so the four cannot
    drift. Compares resolved paths: `load_paths` resolves both sides, but a
    hand-built :class:`ProjectPaths` (tests) need not have."""
