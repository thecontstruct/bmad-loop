"""`bmad-loop tui` application shell.

Observer/launcher only: the TUI never runs engines in-process. Run control
(r/s/e) launches detached bmad-loop processes in the control session via
tui.launch (bmad-loop-ctl on tmux; a per-registry name on psmux, which the
launch toasts print). Dry runs are captured into a text modal; validate
renders its `--json` document into a findings modal (falling back to the text
one), so the verdict is the document's `ok` rather than an exit code.
The g binding opens the policy.toml settings editor.

        A sibling of _show_captured rather than a change to it: that worker still
        serves the two dry runs, which have no document to parse.

        The transport is the subprocess and `--json`, not documents.py's builders
        in-process, which its module docstring otherwise asks a non-CLI frontend
        to prefer. Knowing exception: cmd_validate imports third-party mux entry
        points and probes httpx, so the subprocess quarantines a broken plugin's
        import side effects and leaves the TUI's own lru_cached mux selection
        undisturbed. Extracting an in-process builder is a follow-up.

        The body is guarded because @work(thread=True) defaults to
        exit_on_error=True: a JSONDecodeError or a KeyError escaping here would
        take the whole app down, not just this modal. exit_on_error=False is not
        the fix — that trades the crash for pressing `v` and nothing happening.

        The degrade **re-runs validate in text mode** rather than showing the
        captured JSON. Dumping the document would withhold a perfectly good human
        rendering at the exact moment the structural one failed, and hand the
        reader a wall of `{"schema_version": ...}` instead. One sub-second
        subprocess on a path that should never fire buys a degrade that is
        byte-for-byte the pre-#210 behavior.

        That re-run goes through _run_captured_guarded rather than calling
        run_captured directly: the except above does not cover it, and the two
        legs spawn the same subprocess, so a failure to spawn at all is not a
        JSON-leg failure a text re-run recovers from — it is the same failure
        twice, the second one escaping into exit_on_error.
