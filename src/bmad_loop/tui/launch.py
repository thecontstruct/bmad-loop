"""Detached launching of bmad-loop commands for the TUI.

The TUI never runs engines in-process: run/sweep/resume are launched in new
windows of a dedicated tmux control session (bmad-loop-ctl) so they survive
TUI exit, and the dashboard observes them through run-dir artifacts exactly
like runs started from a plain shell. Fast read-only commands (validate,
--dry-run) are captured instead, for display in a modal.

No textual imports here — everything drives the multiplexer seam (or a plain
subprocess for the captured read-only commands) and is unit-testable.
