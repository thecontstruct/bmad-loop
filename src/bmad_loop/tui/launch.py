"""Detached launching of bmad-loop commands for the TUI.

The TUI never runs engines in-process: run/sweep/resume are launched in new
windows of a dedicated control session (bmad-loop-ctl on tmux, a per-registry
name on psmux — see the CTL_SESSION comment below) so they survive TUI exit,
and the dashboard observes them through run-dir artifacts exactly like runs
started from a plain shell. Fast read-only commands (validate,
--dry-run) are captured instead, for display in a modal.

No textual imports here — everything drives the multiplexer seam (or a plain

    which action_attach (no covering except at all) and _stop_run_worker (whose
    except does not include it) would let escape. An unreadable hint is not an
    error — it just leaves the caller with the name scan.

    The file is the only channel on purpose: `bmad-loop attach` resolves the same
    run from its own process, and one resolve feeding every consumer is the
    property ctl_window_id sells. A per-process memo of what this process last

    Deliberately not `read_text`. The record sits under the project root every
    coding session can write, and this read runs on Textual's event loop
    (`action_attach` calls it directly), so the *shape* of what is at the path
    has to be established before any bytes are consumed:

    * `O_NONBLOCK` + an `S_ISREG` check on the opened descriptor. Opening a FIFO
      for reading otherwise blocks until someone writes — indefinitely, freezing
      the dashboard on a keypress.
    * `O_NOFOLLOW`, so the name is read rather than wherever it points.
    * At most `_MAX_RECORD_BYTES`. A record pointed at an endless source reads
      forever otherwise, and it raises `MemoryError` rather than the OSError
      this promises never to leak — `Exception` would catch that but also mask
      real bugs, where a cap removes the condition instead of absorbing it.

    The check is on the descriptor, not the path, so it cannot be raced: fstat
    describes the object actually opened. The POSIX-only flags degrade to 0 on

    not leave the *previous* launch's id authoritative — that id now names a

    Ceiling: when the removal fails, or is declined because the path cannot be
    vouched for, the superseded id survives on disk. It still has to pass
    ctl_window_id's re-prove, so the worst it can answer is a live window
    carrying this run's name — the pre-fix by-name result, never a wilder target.
    Retaining a stale hint is strictly the cheaper failure here, which is why
    this declines rather than deleting on a path it cannot stand behind.

    Anchored exactly like the write in _record_ctl_window, and for a sharper
    reason: a delete needs no race at all. `unlink` does not follow a link at the
    *final* component, but the ancestors resolve normally, so a run dir standing
    as a link to an external directory makes `run_dir / ctl-window` name a file
    over there — another project's live record — and this deletes it. The write
    path's escape needed the attacker to win a window between check and write;
    a planted link just sits there until the next launch fails to capture an id.
    So the descriptor from `open_dir_confined` is what the unlink is relative to,
    and no path is named. win32 keeps the check-then-delete fallback on the same
    terms as the write — see `_run_dir_is_confined` for that residual.

    `follow_symlinks=False` refuses a link at the *final* component only, which
    leaves the ancestors: a session that replaces `.bmad-loop/runs/<run_id>`
    with a link to an external directory holding a `state.json` passes
    `runs.is_run` — it follows the link — and then `mkstemp`/`os.replace` land
    the record inside the linked-to directory. The escape is narrower than the
    final-component one (the name written is always `ctl-window`, so the reach
    is another project's record rather than any file), but it is the same shape.

    Every component below `project` is checked, and `project` itself is not: the
    operator chooses where the project lives and may well keep it behind a link,
    while everything under it is session-writable. `lstat`-based throughout, so
    the check never resolves through what it is testing for.

    Each component goes through `_is_link_of_any_kind`, not `is_symlink()` —
    on win32 the latter is blind to a junction, which redirects the same way and
    is the easier of the two to plant. That also fixes a quieter gap: `Path`'s

    makes that sentence true.

    A check, not a race-free open: the portable answer would be to walk the

    over an older window sharing the run id.

    Best-effort on purpose. The window is already running by the time this
    writes, so a failed write must not fail the launch — the lookup degrades to
    the name scan, i.e. to the behaviour before this record existed. A failure
    forgets the previous record rather than leaving it: degrading to the scan is
    the intended fallback, answering a superseded window is not.

    Skipped when there is no run yet: a fresh `run`/`sweep` mints the only
    window carrying its run id (nothing to disambiguate), and the run dir is
    created by the detached child — this record deliberately never mkdirs one,
    and must not be written into a run-dir-shaped directory (pruned, partial)
    that runs.is_run reports as not a run.

    That skip forgets too, and the "nothing to disambiguate" clause above is
    exactly why it must. The clause holds for the case it was written for —
    `new_run_id` mints a fresh id, so no other window carries it — but it does
    not hold for every way of reaching this branch. resume/resolve read state,
    raise a confirm modal, and launch from the callback, so anything that
    removes `state.json` inside that human-length window arrives here with a
    predecessor window live and a previous launch's record still on disk. That
    record names the window this launch just superseded, and ctl_window_id
    prefers any record that still resolves — so `a` and `x` would answer the
    parked predecessor while the orchestrator just minted keeps running, which
    is #482's symptom reintroduced by the record meant to fix it. Dropping it
    puts the lookup back on the name scan, which is this file's stated
    preference throughout: degrading to the scan is the intended fallback,
    answering a superseded window is not.

    Atomic, not a bare write_text: the record is read cross-process (`bmad-loop
    attach`), and on win32 an AV/indexer holding the previous record open fails
    a plain overwrite with a transient sharing violation — which would swallow
    into the forget path and quietly degrade the lookup. atomic_replace retries
    exactly that violation, turning most real-world failures into successes.

    The guard is type-agnostic on purpose, and `OSError` is not wide enough to
    hold it: `atomic_write_text` resolves the path before its own try, and below
    3.13 `Path.resolve` reports a symlink loop as `RuntimeError` — which would
    crash the launch this docstring promises to spare, on the interpreters the
    3.11/3.12 legs run. Same widening, same reason, as the engine's deferred-close
    rollback (`Engine._restore_deferred_closes`). `Exception` and not
    `BaseException`, so a genuine KeyboardInterrupt still gets out.

    `follow_symlinks=False`, so a symlink at the path is replaced rather than
    written through. Following one is the helper's default contract ("a ledger
    symlinked into the repo keeps being a symlink"), and it is right there — for
    an operator-curated ledger. This sidecar is the opposite: machine-minted,
    per-run, disposable, and living under the project root that every coding
    session can write. Honouring a link here would let a session aim a
    *host-side* write at any path the user can write — reach that the adapters
    confining a session to the workspace otherwise deny it. The payload is only
    a window id, so the primitive is truncation rather than injection, which
    bounds the damage without making it acceptable.

    Replacing rather than refusing, and no preflight `is_symlink` check: a check
    leaves the window between itself and the write, which a session that
    re-plants the link wins. `os.replace` does not dereference its destination,
    so the link is clobbered whenever it was planted. That also self-heals — the
    record ends up a plain file again — where a refusal would leave the planted
    link in place for the next launch to trip over.

    Anchored at a directory descriptor where the platform has one. The final
    component is covered by `follow_symlinks=False` above, but the *ancestors*
    are not, and a path check over them (`_run_dir_is_confined`) is answered
    about a path — stale the moment it returns, so a session that re-plants
    `.bmad-loop/runs/<run_id>` between check and write still redirects the
    record out of the workspace. `open_dir_confined` walks those components
    `O_NOFOLLOW` and hands back the descriptor for the directory it reached, and
    `atomic_write_text_at` then never names a path again — so a later swap
    renames something this no longer consults, and there is no window to win.

    win32 keeps the check-then-write path: it has no `*at()` family to anchor
    against (its CPython config defines neither HAVE_RENAMEAT nor HAVE_OPENAT),
    so the descriptor cannot be opened there at all. The residual is documented
    on `_run_dir_is_confined` and bounded by the two facts it names — same uid
    as the writer, and a fixed filename carrying a window id.

    not launched from the TUI or the session is gone.

    An id, not a name, because every consumer replays the value as a
    select/kill/option target: one resolve feeds all of them, so a rename or a
    window minted between two verbs cannot send them to different windows, and
    the value survives tmux's automatic-rename.

    `<kind>-<run_id>` is not unique — a resume launched over a still-parked run
    window shares the run id, and nothing reaps the parked one in between — so
    the name scan alone answers whichever match the listing emits first (tmux
    orders by window *index*, and it gives a new window the lowest free index,
    so a superseded window usually but not always sorts ahead of the live one).
    The id the run's last launch minted is recorded in the run dir and wins
    whenever the listing still shows it under this run id. A record that is gone

    no-op). With no record at all the answer is the first match, exactly as

    Scoped to `project` by the PROJECT_OPTION tag, on the same rule as
    _ctl_window_candidates: the control session is shared across projects, and a

    same-id window belonging to another project would otherwise be a legal match
    here — for `x` that means killing a *live* orchestrator next door. An
    untagged window is admitted when this project has the run dir, which keeps a
    window whose (best-effort) tag write failed reachable by its own project
    rather than by nobody.

    Untagged is a *fallback*, not a peer: an untagged window proves nothing
    about who owns it, so it is consulted only when nothing carries this
    project's tag. Merged into one listing-ordered list they would compete on
    index, and a neighbouring project's untagged window listed first would beat
    this project's correctly tagged one — for `x`, killing next door's

      - a pane target (backend-composed: bare %N on tmux, =session:%N on
        psmux): switch that client back there (`-l` fallback if it's gone);
      - RETURN_DETACH: detach the client so a blocking `tmux attach` returns;
      - unset/empty: nobody attached with a return target — do nothing.
    The option is cleared only on RETURNED: a real return must not make the
    parked window's trailer fire a second one, a failed return is left for the
    trailer to retry. That retry is a second chance, not a rescue —
    new_parked_window parks on a blocking read *before* the trailer, so it runs
    only once a human dismisses the park prompt, never in the unattended case.

    The two failures are not interchangeable, which is why this answers a
    ReturnOutcome and not a bool. A failed switch is positive evidence that the
    client is still in this window, so ATTENDED keeps the caller prompting —
    but only because the seam reserves False for that joint claim. A backend
    that merely cannot vouch for the move (psmux's timed-out verb, an
    unreadable client count, nothing attached to move) answers None, and that
    lands in UNREACHABLE instead. The routing is load-bearing, not tidiness:
    an ATTENDED the client has already walked away from cannot be recovered by
    the surviving return option, because a --repeat cycle prompting into the
    empty window blocks on input() before anyone can reach the trailer. A
    failed detach carries no such evidence in general: on tmux it does
    (`detach-client` fails with "no current client"), but off tmux False also
    covers an effect the backend could not observe and a detach verb it does
    not have at all — herdr, whose False rather than None is exactly what
    detach_client's own widening to a returned bool (#317) buys. That is a
    different widening from switch_client's third state above; detach_client is
    the verb that stays a bool. UNREACHABLE is the policy for all of them, the
    unvouched switch included, because the two ways of being wrong are not
    equally bad: prompting into a
    window no one is viewing blocks a --repeat sweep on input() forever, while
    going unattended in front of a human only defers this cycle's decisions to

    that one partitions BEFORE its kills, so its `killed` is still an attempted
    kill, its `live` is "deliberately not touched" rather than "survived", and its
    `unknown` is a pid question and a SUBSET of `killed`. These three are disjoint
    (by window id — the values are names) and all three are about kill outcome.

    kill_window is best-effort by contract (a hang, a missing binary, and a
    refused kill are all the same silent no-op), so an attempted kill is not a
    removal and must not be reported as one (#435). The verdict is taken here
    rather than pushed into the seam because this is the caller that both needs
    it and already holds the session: kill_window(target) alone cannot verify
    anything on a backend whose liveness listing is session-scoped, which is all
    of them.

    ONE listing after the whole fan-out, not a probe per window: the answer is a
    set membership either way, so the verdict costs one extra round trip instead
    of N. A transport fault raises and nothing can be claimed there.

    Two ceilings, both deliberate:

    - The membership test pairs list_windows' `window_id` column with
      list_window_ids. The seam states its symmetry rules pairwise and this pair
      is stated because of THIS caller — a backend qualifying one side and not
      the other reads every candidate as removed, which is #435 restored on the
      optimistic side, with no error anywhere.
    - `[]` is read as "the session went with its last window". The seam's `[]`
      is wider than that: BaseTmuxBackend folds EVERY nonzero exit to `[]`, so a
      server that errors while its windows live would report them removed. The
      common cause by far is the session really being gone, and pessimism there
      would invent a phantom survivor on every future sweep. Narrowing the

    Separation is the whole point of this seam. Anything parsing stdout as a
    whole document — a ``--json`` command, whose contract in :mod:`bmad_loop.machine`
    is that stdout is one JSON object and nothing else — cannot use the merged
    form: :func:`run_captured` appends stderr *after* stdout, so a single
    ``DeprecationWarning`` written to the child's stderr by any dependency turns
    ``json.loads`` into ``Extra data:``. That failure is environment-dependent —
    it needs the right interpreter, the right installed versions, the right
    warning filters — so it would pass everywhere it was tested and silently
    degrade the JSON path to the text one on a user's machine. A caller that
    genuinely wants one blob merges them itself; a caller that parses must never
    have been handed the option.

    Decoding is pinned to UTF-8 with ``errors="replace"`` rather than
    ``text=True``, which decodes with the *locale* encoding at ``errors="strict"``
    — the #200 family of failure already fixed CLI-side in :mod:`bmad_loop.machine`.
    A console in a non-UTF-8 code page must not turn a perfectly good document
    into a ``UnicodeDecodeError`` on the way in.
