"""Read-only filesystem observation layer for the TUI.

Everything the dashboard shows comes from the run-dir artifacts the engine
already writes atomically: state.json (os.replace), journal.jsonl
(append-only), logs/<task-id>.log, ATTENTION. This module never imports
textual — it is plain stdlib + core modules + pyte/rich, fully unit-testable,
and the screens own the poll cadence.

All readers are stat-gated: parse results are cached while the file's
(mtime_ns, size, inode) is unchanged. Liveness is the exception — a dying engine
changes no file, so the pid is re-checked on every call.
