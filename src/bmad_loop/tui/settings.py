"""tomlkit-backed editing model for .bmad-loop/policy.toml.

Zero textual imports: this is the testable core of the settings editor. The
form never re-implements policy rules — validate() round-trips the document
through policy.loads(), so policy.py stays the single source of truth.
tomlkit preserves comments and key order; a missing file starts from
POLICY_TEMPLATE so the first save carries the full inline documentation.
