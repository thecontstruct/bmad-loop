"""`bmad-loop diagnose`: a sanitized diagnostic dump of a run/sweep.

When a run or sweep misbehaves, a maintainer needs to see the *shape* of what
happened — phase transitions, escalations, token usage, which adapter/model ran,
how sessions ended — but must NEVER receive the user's proprietary code, spec or
story content, prompts, transcripts, file paths, or any PII. This command derives
that diagnostic shape from a run dir and routes every content-bearing value
through the audited :mod:`bmad_loop.sanitize` chokepoint before rendering.

It mirrors :mod:`bmad_loop.probe`: typed findings → collectors → ``render_markdown``
/ ``render_json``. On the CLI the default is the markdown report and ``--json``
selects the pure JSON document instead (the :mod:`bmad_loop.machine` contract —
one object on stdout, nothing else); ``--out FILE`` redirects whichever of the
two was selected to a file. The safety model is fail-closed by construction:
structure (counts, enums, ints, durations) is derived
directly; every value that could carry content is dropped, reduced to a boolean,
**pseudonymized** (story keys/branches/SHAs are identifier-shaped and would
otherwise survive verbatim), or scrubbed. Unknown/future fields default to a
``scrub_json`` pass, never raw. As a final backstop the rendered bytes are run
through :func:`sanitize.guard` — the fail-closed egress self-check shared with
``probe-adapter`` since #199. A stray pseudonymized original (a
per-field routing gap — the value is in the legend, so its safe alias is known)
is **repaired** by substituting the alias, re-verified, and disclosed in the
dump itself — a "Backstop repairs" section in the markdown report, an optional
top-level ``backstop_repairs`` label→count key in the JSON document — so the gap
still surfaces as a reportable bug even when only one of the two was rendered.
A genuine PII/secret/path/username hit, or a repair that does not converge,
raises so the command refuses to write.

The guiding assumption: the dump will be posted publicly.

# `checkpoint-pause` journals `task.spec_file`, which `StoryTask` persists
# worktree-relative (a bare basename for a spec at the worktree root). Aliasing
# the raw string would give ONE spec TWO aliases in a single dump, defeating the
# correlation these fields are aliased rather than dropped to preserve, and would
# park an absolute home path in the local `--legend` file (before `spec` was
# routed such a value died at `scrub_json` and never entered the map at all).
