"""`bmad-loop diagnose`: a sanitized diagnostic dump of a run/sweep.

When a run or sweep misbehaves, a maintainer needs to see the *shape* of what
happened — phase transitions, escalations, token usage, which adapter/model ran,
how sessions ended — but must NEVER receive the user's proprietary code, spec or
story content, prompts, transcripts, file paths, or any PII. This command derives
that diagnostic shape from a run dir and routes every content-bearing value
through the audited :mod:`bmad_loop.sanitize` chokepoint before rendering.

It mirrors :mod:`bmad_loop.probe`: typed findings → collectors → ``render_markdown``
/ ``render_json``. On the CLI the default is the markdown report and ``--json``
selects the pure JSON document instead (the :mod:`bmad_loop.machine` contract —
one object on stdout, nothing else); ``--out FILE`` redirects whichever of the
two was selected to a file. The safety model is fail-closed by construction:
structure (counts, enums, ints, durations) is derived
directly; every value that could carry content is dropped, reduced to a boolean,
**pseudonymized** (story keys/branches/SHAs are identifier-shaped and would
otherwise survive verbatim), or scrubbed. Unknown/future fields default to a
``scrub_json`` pass, never raw. As a final backstop the rendered bytes are run
through :func:`sanitize.guard` — the fail-closed egress self-check shared with
``probe-adapter`` since #199. That backstop re-scans the rendered bytes for known
*shapes* — email, URL credentials, credential-shaped tokens, the absolute-home
spellings in both separator forms (#512 added the backslash WSL-UNC one), and *this
process's* username — and refuses to emit on a hit; it is not a proof of absence, since
a home spelling it does not know, or a username that is not this process's (the Linux
account behind a WSL UNC path), passes it untouched. Per-field routing is the primary
defense and the guard is defense in depth. A stray pseudonymized original (a
per-field routing gap — the value is in the legend, so its safe alias is known)
is **repaired** by substituting the alias, re-verified, and disclosed in the
dump itself — a "Backstop repairs" section in the markdown report, an optional
top-level ``backstop_repairs`` label→count key in the JSON document — so the gap
still surfaces as a reportable bug even when only one of the two was rendered.
A genuine PII/secret/path/username hit, or a repair that does not converge,
raises so the command refuses to write.

The guiding assumption: the dump will be posted publicly.

# `-carry-foreign-dirt`, `-carry-uncommitted`). Aliasing it by NAME would pseudonymize
# statuses as branches, turning a legible `"target": "done"` into `branch-3f2a` and
# destroying the field a maintainer reads those kinds for; leaving it unrouted — what
# happened until now — ships an identifier-shaped branch name VERBATIM. A normal run
# journals the same string as `branch` first (`ensure_target_branch`), so the egress
# backstop repairs it and discloses a `backstop_repairs` gap, but that is a defense in
# depth that only works because the value is already in the legend: a journal truncated
# past that event, or a `unit-merged` read out of a bundle on its own, has nothing to

#
# Deliberately NOT fixed by renaming the producers to `target_branch`, which is the

# reads a journal written by an earlier process — and possibly an earlier version. A

# already landed. The scrub is what is wrong, so the scrub is where the fix belongs.
