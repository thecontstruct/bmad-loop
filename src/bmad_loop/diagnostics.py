"""`bmad-loop diagnose`: a sanitized diagnostic dump of a run/sweep.

When a run or sweep misbehaves, a maintainer needs to see the *shape* of what
happened — phase transitions, escalations, token usage, which adapter/model ran,
how sessions ended — but must NEVER receive the user's proprietary code, spec or
story content, prompts, transcripts, file paths, or any PII. This command derives
that diagnostic shape from a run dir and routes every content-bearing value
through the audited :mod:`bmad_loop.sanitize` chokepoint before rendering.

It mirrors :mod:`bmad_loop.probe`: typed findings → collectors → ``render_markdown``
/ ``render_json``. On the CLI the default is the markdown report and ``--json``
selects the pure JSON document instead (the :mod:`bmad_loop.machine` contract —
one object on stdout, nothing else); ``--out FILE`` redirects whichever of the
two was selected to a file. The safety model is fail-closed by construction:
structure (counts, enums, ints, durations) is derived
directly; every value that could carry content is dropped, reduced to a boolean,
**pseudonymized** (story keys/branches/SHAs are identifier-shaped and would
otherwise survive verbatim), or scrubbed. Unknown/future fields default to a
``scrub_json`` pass, never raw. As a final backstop the rendered bytes are run
through :func:`sanitize.guard` — the fail-closed egress self-check shared with
``probe-adapter`` since #199. That backstop re-scans the rendered bytes for known
*shapes* — email, URL credentials, credential-shaped tokens, the absolute-home
spellings in both separator forms (#512 added the backslash WSL-UNC one), and *this
process's* username — and refuses to emit on a hit; it is not a proof of absence, since
a home spelling it does not know, or a username that is not this process's (the Linux
account behind a WSL UNC path), passes it untouched. Per-field routing is the primary
defense and the guard is defense in depth. A stray pseudonymized original (a
per-field routing gap — the value is in the legend, so its safe alias is known)
is **repaired** by substituting the alias, re-verified, and disclosed in the
dump itself — a "Backstop repairs" section in the markdown report, an optional
top-level ``backstop_repairs`` label→count key in the JSON document — so the gap
still surfaces as a reportable bug even when only one of the two was rendered.
A genuine PII/secret/path/username hit, or a repair that does not converge,
raises so the command refuses to write.

The guiding assumption: the dump will be posted publicly.

# Deliberately NOT bumped when `--json` stopped being a fenced ```json block
# inside the markdown report and became a pure document (machine.py contract):
# this number versions the *document*, and the payload did not change. Bumping it
# would falsely tell a consumer pinned to v1 that the fields it reads are gone,
# while a consumer actually broken by the repackaging finds out immediately —
# the fence is gone and json.loads fails. Bump only on a payload break.
# v2 replaces journal-entry `patch` / `stashed_to` values with the presence keys
# `patch_present` / `stashed_to_present`.
# v3 does the same thing to two more journal-entry values, which is the same
# payload break for the same reason: `question` (on `decision-pending`) becomes
# `question_present`, and on `preference-escalation` EVERY key outside the
# `{type, severity, detail}` schema becomes `<name>_present` — see
# `_JOURNAL_KIND_SCHEMAS`. A consumer reading `entry["question"]` finds it gone,
# so this is a break under `machine.py`'s additive-only rule, exactly as v2 was.
# The third change shipping with it — `_JOURNAL_KEYLIST_FIELDS` failing closed on a
# non-list value — is deliberately NOT part of this rationale, but the reason is the
# JSONL ROUND-TRIP, not the call sites. Two producers do pass a tuple
# (`sweep.py`'s `dw_ids=(decision.id,)` and `dw_ids=tuple(task.dw_ids)`), so a survey
# of producers would be the wrong argument and is false as such. What makes it a
# non-break is that `_scrub_entry` never sees a producer's object: entries are
# serialized to `journal.jsonl` and read back, and JSON has no tuple type, so every
# sequence arrives as a `list` and takes the same arm it always did. The new arm is
# reachable only by a shape no round-tripped entry can hold.
# v4 removes the overloaded journal-entry `path` value in favour of `path_present`
# and replaces `stale-restore-excluded.files` with `files_count`. The same release
# explicitly aliases `stale-restore-commits.commits` and `sentinel-cleared.sentinel`;
# those two fields keep their names, but their values no longer carry source ids.

    # error path — a DIFFERENT function, which is why "the only producer" is no longer
    # the right shape for this note. A SIXTH and a SEVENTH kind,
    # `accepted-spec-write-unreachable` and `accepted-spec-delivery-unreachable`, are
    # NOT re-arm records at all: both are written mid-run, from another module
    # entirely, by `worktree_flow` — the first by `_warn_accepted_spec_superseded`
    # when a fresh mount supersedes an accepted-but-uncommitted spec (DW-101), the
    # second by `_warn_accepted_spec_undelivered` when the mount cannot be shown to
    # carry that spec at all (DW-104, DW-115). Both carry the same two
    # hazardous fields as `rearm-spec-write-unreachable` — `spec_file` here and
    # `target_branch` above — plus one bare boolean discriminator apiece, `compared`
    # and `located`, declared benign in the routing guard. Routing is by field NAME,
    # not by kind, so the list
    # is documentation rather than a gate — but an enumeration that undercounts is how
    # the next reader concludes a kind is unrouted, so it is corrected rather than
    # left to age. `rearm-aborted` also carries `error` (dropped as free text) and
    # `rollback`, a literal enum string declared benign in the routing guard.
    # `engine._park_awaiting_operator` passes
    # `spec_file=` to `operatoractions.record_park`, which is a record file, not the
    # journal. So the divergence is BETWEEN FIELDS, not between two producers of this
    # one — but BOTH fields are mixed-shape, and neither is the reliable one:
    # Both fields now journal an absolute path wherever they carry one: `spec_file`
    # through `str(task_spec_path(...))` on all five kinds — `rearm-aborted` forwards
    # the same already-anchored value, and writes `""` rather than a story key when the
    # aborted re-arm never resolved a spec path — and `spec` through
    # `engine._operator_spec_path` (which anchors `checkpoint-pause` the same
    # way) alongside engine's already-absolute reconcile and marker-repair kinds. Same
    # value, same namespace. Do NOT read that convergence as "both fields are
    # normalized, so the basename step is dead" — it is not a guarantee this module
    # holds. `_operator_spec_path` still answers a bare STORY KEY for a spec-less task,
    # nothing stops a future producer from journaling a raw `task.spec_file`, and
    # `_JOURNAL_BASENAME_NAMESPACES` keys on the NAMESPACE rather than the field
    # precisely so every spelling reduces to one alias whichever shape it carries.

# the target BRANCH on the three merge kinds below and a sprint STATUS on the

# statuses as branches, turning a legible `"target": "done"` into `branch-3f2a` and
# destroying the field a maintainer reads those kinds for; leaving it unrouted — what
# happened until now — ships an identifier-shaped branch name VERBATIM. A normal run
# journals the same string as `branch` first (`ensure_target_branch`), so the egress
# backstop repairs it and discloses a `backstop_repairs` gap, but that is a defense in
# depth that only works because the value is already in the legend: a journal truncated
# past that event, or a `unit-merged` read out of a bundle on its own, has nothing to
# repair from.

# Deliberately NOT fixed by renaming the producers to `target_branch`, which is the

# already landed. The scrub is what is wrong, so the scrub is where the fix belongs.

# The declared shape is ``{type, severity, detail}``. Its PROVENANCE, stated
# precisely because an earlier version of this comment got it wrong: the sole
# producer of this kind is ``engine._review_and_commit``, splatting a
# bmad-build-auto REVIEW session's ``result.json`` entries. Sweep does not journal
# ``preference-escalation`` at all. ``data/skills/bmad-loop-sweep/automation-mode.md``
# declares the same three-key shape for a DIFFERENT session type, so it corroborates
# the shape and is not the contract that produces this record. Anything outside those
# three keys is off-schema and has no diagnostic claim on being shown verbatim.
#
# ⚠️ ACCEPTED RESIDUAL — decided 2026-08-30, not an oversight, and NOT to be
# re-filed or "fixed" as a fresh finding. This table closes the NAME axis only, and
# three things still reach the dump. Stated in full, because a disclosure that
# understates its own scope is the same defect as a comment naming the wrong
# mechanism.
#
#  1. The key NAME. ``AcmeVaultTenant=1`` renders as ``AcmeVaultTenant_present``.
#     A name-free collapse (a single ``unrouted_field_count`` integer) closes this
#     and was OFFERED AND DECLINED, in favour of the per-key marker's diagnostic
#     value — a maintainer can see WHICH off-schema key a session invented, which is
#     most of why the record is read. The suffix also carries the name PAST the
#     egress backstop: `sanitize.guard` repairs a pseudonymizer original only where
#     it stands alone, and ``AcmeVaultTenant_present`` is one token to it — so a
#     key that happens to be a registered story key or branch is not re-aliased
#     here the way the same string would be as a bare value.
#  2. Arbitrary key SHAPES, which follows from 1 and is easy to miss: nothing
#     constrains an LLM-authored key to be identifier-shaped, so a free-text key
#     survives as a JSON key with the suffix glued on —
#     ``"customer AcmeVault owes 5k"`` renders as
#     ``"customer AcmeVault owes 5k_present"`` (reproduced).
#  3. The VALUES of the three DECLARED names, which this table does not touch at
#     all: they stay on the ``scrub_json`` fallback, so
#     ``type="acmevault-tenant-isolation"`` and ``severity="AcmeVaultHigh"`` both come
#     back byte-identical, as does a container in a declared name
#     (``type={"customer": "AcmeVault"}``) — all reproduced.
#
# Do NOT "fix" 3 by routing ``type``/``severity``: the intent this table implements
# requires the declared schema to be emitted as it is today, on the ground that
# collapsing it destroys the field the record is read for. A further leak here is
# DISCLOSED — which is what this comment is — never routed.
#
# ``detail`` is named here for completeness even though ``_JOURNAL_DROP_FIELDS``
# reaches it first: the set states the record's schema, and a schema that omitted a
# field because some other table happened to cover it would mislead the next reader.
