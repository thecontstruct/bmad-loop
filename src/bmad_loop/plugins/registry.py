"""PluginRegistry: the inter-pillar contract.

The registry collapses discovery + trust + in-process resolution into one
read-only object the rest of the system consumes:

  * the settings pillar reads ``settings_schema()``;
  * the hook bus reads ``hooks_for(stage)``;
  * custom orchestration reads ``provided_workflows()``.

Neither consumer reaches into loader internals. Building the registry is the
single place trust is enforced and failure is isolated:

  * a plugin with no ``[python]`` loads as a data-only/declarative LoadedPlugin
    (instance None) — its shell hooks are available to the bus;
  * a ``[python]`` plugin is constructed only if it is in ``[plugins] enabled``
    (``trust.require_enabled`` gates ``exec_module``); otherwise it is recorded
    untrusted and its module is never imported;
  * any exception while importing/constructing a trusted instance is caught
    (``except Exception`` — never ``BaseException``, so RunStopped/SIGTERM
    propagate), journalled, and the instance disabled. The run survives.
