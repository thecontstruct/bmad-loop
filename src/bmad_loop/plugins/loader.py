"""Discover + load plugin manifests (folder-drop now; entry-points later).

Discovery walks three sources in overlay precedence — exactly the
builtin-then-project pattern of ``load_profiles`` (adapters/profile.py), with an
entry-point source wedged in the middle as a locked future-additive seam:

    builtin (bmad_loop.data/plugins/*)         lowest precedence
    entry_point (bmad_loop.plugins group)      written, returns nothing today
    project (<project>/.bmad-loop/plugins/*)   highest precedence (same-name override)

Each plugin is a directory holding ``plugin.toml`` plus any helper scripts; the
directory is its ``{scripts}`` dir. Resolving bundled plugins to a real
filesystem path assumes a regular (non-zipped) install — the same assumption the
rest of the package makes for packaged skills/profiles/engines.

api_version mismatch handling lives here because it is source-dependent: a
builtin we ship with the wrong version is a packaging bug (hard error); a
third-party plugin written for a newer/older API is skipped with a warning so a
stale drop-in can never take a run down.
