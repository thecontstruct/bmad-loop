"""Model of stories.yaml — the Story Breakdown manifest for "stories mode".

The optional Story Breakdown step of `bmad-spec` emits ``stories.yaml``, a
fixed-name sibling of ``SPEC.md`` in the spec folder (discovered by name, never
referenced from frontmatter). It is a flat list, one entry per story, in strict
execution order — **there is no ``depends_on`` field**, so the schedule is a
single left-to-right scan, not a DAG. Each entry pins a stable, prefix-free,
machine-opaque ``id`` plus ``title``/``description`` and the caller-only knobs
``spec_checkpoint`` / ``done_checkpoint`` / ``invoke_dev_with`` /
``closes_deferred``. ``status`` is deliberately absent: bmad-spec is the sole
writer of ``stories.yaml`` and bmad-dev-auto is the sole writer of each story
spec's status — the orchestrator writes neither.

This module is the strict, typed parser the orchestrator reads it through. The
upstream schema (validity rule 4) already says ids are quoted strings of
letters/digits/dashes, but an LLM-authored file may still emit an unquoted
``id: 1`` (PyYAML -> int) or ``id: 3.5`` (-> float); we ``str()``-normalize then
charset-validate as defense-in-depth. Everything here is pure contract: no
engine or sprint-mode coupling (only :mod:`verify`'s frontmatter readers, for
the id-keyed disk resolution).
