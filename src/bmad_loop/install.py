"""`bmad-loop init`: make a target project orchestratable.

- copies the hook relay script to <project>/.bmad-loop/bmad_loop_hook.py
- idempotently merges hook registrations into each selected CLI's hook config
  (dialect + native->canonical event map come from the CLI profile)
- installs the bundled bmad-loop-* skills into each selected CLI's skill tree
  (.claude/skills for claude, .agents/skills for codex/gemini/copilot)
- writes .bmad-loop/policy.toml from the template (if missing)
- gitignores generated dirs: .bmad-loop/runs/ (per-run state) and
  .bmad-loop/cache/ (engine plugins' rebuildable caches, e.g. the Unity Library)

Every dialect registers the same relay script under the CLI's native event
names while passing the canonical event name as the script argument, so the
orchestrator's signal watcher is CLI-agnostic.

    The primitive's installed NAME is resolved from disk here rather than taken as
    an argument (:func:`dev_primitive_or_default`): both call sites — the preflight
    and worktree provisioning — hold exactly ``(project, tree)`` and would otherwise
    each compute the same value to hand back. On a renamed project the legacy paths
    are simply absent, so without this the resolution silently returns None and the
    caller degrades to the static catalog — quietly seeding a worktree with the
    wrong reviewers instead of the ones this project configured.

    Post-consolidation the primitive is layer-driven: each
    ``[[workflow.review_layers]]`` entry carries its whole execution recipe, and a
    layer that runs a skill names it inline (an empty ``instruction`` disables the
    layer, and a layer may legitimately name no skill at all — `intent-alignment`
    is a self-contained prompt). Pre-consolidation, ``step-04-review.md`` names its
    reviewers directly instead.

    Reading whichever is installed keeps the preflight honest as upstream moves:
    a project whose configured layers invoke a skill it does not have is otherwise
    green here and broken on every dev run (#260). None means the shape could not
    be determined, so the caller falls back to the static catalog.

    A ``when``-gated layer contributes ADVISORY requirements only: step-04 skips
    every layer whose condition does not hold, and that condition is evaluated by
    the model in run context — undecidable here, so hard-requiring its skill would
    be a false FAIL.

def missing_base_skills(project: Path, trees: Sequence[str]) -> list[Finding]:
    """Problems for the upstream skills the orchestrator drives but doesn't bundle.

    The dev primitive (bmad-build-auto, or a complete pre-rename bmad-dev-auto) and
    the review layers its step-04 invokes inline are installed by the BMad Method
    module, not by `bmad-loop init`. Each must exist in every ``trees`` entry —
    callers pass the :data:`DEV_PRIMITIVE_ROLES` trees, since only a dev or review
    session ever dispatches one of these — and carry its marker files. Returns one
    :class:`Finding` per missing/incomplete skill; empty list means OK. Run as a
    preflight so a missing skill fails loudly with remediation instead of stalling
    as an `Unknown command` until the run times out.

    Not every finding is fatal: review layers that are conditional, ambiguously
    phrased, or configured by an unparseable override come back as ``warning``
    (see :func:`_review_findings`). **Callers must branch on severity** — treating
    a non-empty return as failure turns every advisory into a blocked run.

    The primitive is resolved per tree (:func:`resolve_dev_primitive`) before any
    marker check, so the markers are asserted against the skill this run would
    actually drive. That splits the failures three ways:

    - ``skills.base-incomplete`` — one resolved, but it is truncated.
    - ``skills.base-shim`` — nothing resolved, yet a legacy-named SKILL.md is there.
    - ``skills.base-missing`` — nothing at all under either name.

    A truncated *legacy* install is byte-for-byte the same shape as the shim (old
    SKILL.md, absent markers), so it lands on ``base-shim`` rather than
    ``base-incomplete``; nothing on disk can tell those two apart, so the message
    names both causes and the single remediation they share. What the ids DO
    separate is what a consumer can act on differently: resolved-but-truncated
    (reinstall that skill) vs nothing-usable-resolved (update the module).

    The review skills are read from the installed primitive itself
    (:func:`resolve_review_layers`) so the preflight requires what this project
    will really invoke: a tree whose configured layers call the merged
    ``bmad-review`` needs that skill and not the standalone hunters, and a tree on
    the pre-consolidation step-04 needs the two hunters it names. When the shape
    can't be read we fall back to the static catalog, with a present
    ``bmad-review`` satisfying the hunters. Everything is per tree, since a project
    can have a post-consolidation `.claude` tree and a pre-merge `.agents` one side
    by side — and, across the rename, a different primitive era in each.

    ``skills.base-incomplete`` carries ``missing_markers`` as a list — the message
    joins it with ", " for the human line, which a consumer would otherwise have to
    split back apart on a separator the message is free to change.

    A resolved renderer stub is also checked at the project-global and
    skill-relative surfaces whose absence deterministically HALTs before the
    workflow can write its contract:

    - ``skills.dev-renderer``: a required project-relative renderer script-unit
      member is absent (``missing_scripts`` detail, per tree);
    - ``skills.dev-renderer-config``: the project-global required config is absent
      (emitted once even when multiple trees resolve a stub);
    - ``skills.dev-renderer-sources``: the skill-relative workflow entry or a
      declared snapshot source is absent (``missing_sources`` detail, per tree).

    These are independent of the ordinary marker check: a damaged primitive may
    need both remediations. All are content-gated on the installed SKILL.md, so an
    inline pre-renderer install sees byte-stable behavior.

    One condition, and it is genuinely survivable — which is what keeps it out of
    :func:`missing_base_skills`:

    - ``skills.customize-legacy``: at least one tree resolved to the NEW name while a
      customization override still sits under the OLD one with no counterpart, i.e.
      the rename silently orphaned it. Emitted once per project (the override files
      are project-global, not per tree). The session still runs; it just runs
      unstyled, so naming it is an operator heads-up rather than a gate.

    ⚠️ The remediation is COPY, not rename, whenever another active tree still
    resolves to the legacy primitive. A project can sit mid-upgrade with a different
    era in each tree (`.claude/skills` on the new name, `.agents/skills` still on a
    marker-complete old one), and each tree resolves its overrides under its OWN
    era — so the legacy file is orphaned for the new tree and LIVE for the legacy
    one. Telling that operator to rename it moves the customization from one tree to
    the other instead of fixing anything. Suppressing the finding instead would be
    the opposite error: the new tree really is running unstyled, which is precisely
    the silent degradation this warning exists to surface.

    Deliberately a warning and not a problem. :func:`missing_base_skills` feeds a
    gate with no severity filter and no ``--force``: a false FAIL there pauses every
    run behind a remediation nobody can apply, so on these checks a false green is
    the safe direction. The orphaned file's layers really are inert for a new-era
    tree — upstream's resolver keys on the skill dir — so the honest response is to
    say so and name the rename, not to block.

# One floor, named once, in the module that owns the git chokepoint.

# The shield's mutual exclusion, held in the repository's COMMON dir so every

# concurrent run its own lock and exclude nothing. A dedicated file, never config
# or the exclude itself, per `file_lock`'s contract: the lock rides an open fd's
# inode, so anything written through `atomic_replace` swaps that inode out from
# under later acquirers. Zero bytes, and inside `.git` — never in the working tree,
# so it is not something the operator's `git add -A` can see.

# THE ALTERNATIVE ARCHITECTURE, EVALUATED AND REJECTED — recorded here the way the
# `--includes` note below is, so a later reader does not re-propose it as a
# simplification of the whole block.
#
# Every finding in this family (an empty seed plus an activation that shadows what
# the seed failed to copy) exists because the shield SHADOWS a config key. One
# design dissolves the class outright: drop `core.excludesFile` entirely and instead
# unstage the tool paths in the orchestrator's own commit path — `git reset --
# <paths>` after the `add -A` at `verify.py:1891` and `:1932`. No shadow, so no
# seed, no `_shield_inherited_excludes`, no permanent `extensions.worktreeConfig`,
# no version floor. It is MECHANICALLY REACHABLE: those adds are the orchestrator's
# own, not an LLM's (no skill in `data/skills/` runs git).
#
# Rejected on the merits, for two reasons that are about correctness rather than
# scope:
#
# - It converts AMBIENT protection into CALL-SITE protection. An ignore binds
#   whoever runs the add; a reset covers only the call sites we remember to patch.
#   These adds run around disposable coding-CLI sessions that have shell access and
#   can stage and commit on their own initiative, so the shield has to hold for a
#   `git add -A` bmad-loop never issued. That actor is the one we cannot constrain,
#   and the reset design is the one that stops protecting against it.
# - It leaves the tool files permanently UNTRACKED-VISIBLE in the worktree. Every
#   `git status` a session runs would list the skill trees, the per-CLI hook config
#   and the seeded configs as untracked — inviting exactly the commit the shield
#   exists to prevent, from exactly that actor.
#
# The shadow is also structural, not an artifact of this implementation, so there is
# no third way to look for: gitignore(5) documents four pattern sources and the
# per-repo one is `$GIT_COMMON_DIR/info/exclude` — the COMMON dir, shared by every
# worktree. There is no per-worktree exclude file, `core.excludesFile` is singular,
# and git never concatenates the key across scopes. Checked against current sources
# at git 2.55.0, the newest release.

    """`key`'s raw value in the SHARED config, or None when it is definitely ABSENT.

    Raises `GitError` when git did not answer. **rc 1 is the only non-zero rc that
    means "no such key"** (#384) — reading any other non-zero rc as an absence
    degrades the `core.bare` / `core.worktree` gates OPEN, and what they guard is
    irreversible: enabling `extensions.worktreeConfig` drops the exception that
    confined those keys to the main worktree, after which a genuine `core.worktree`
    starts applying to every linked worktree.

    The rc mapping, stable across the supported range, `GIT_FLOOR` to current git:

        absent key ......................... 1     malformed config file ..... 128
        missing file ....................... 1     --type=bool on a non-bool . 128
        `--file` naming a directory ........ 1     key present ................ 0
        unreadable file (EACCES, non-root) . 1     empty or valueless key ..... 0

    git-config(1) prefaces its own list with "Some exit codes are:", i.e. the list is
    not closed, and it documents a malformed file as ret=3 while git actually answers
    128 — so a `{0,1}`-closed reading is wrong on git's documentation AND on its
    behavior. Hence a funnel rather than a per-rc taxonomy.

    THE RESIDUAL THIS CANNOT CLOSE: a momentarily missing or unreadable `.git/config`
    answers **rc 1**, byte-identical to "no such key" — all four rc-1 rows above are
    the same answer from here. git exposes no way to separate them, so this is a
    bound on the interface rather than a defect. Deliberately NOT narrowed with a
    pre-`--get` stat: that is TOCTOU, which shrinks the window instead of closing it,
    adds a syscall to every probe, and trades a very rare silent-wrong for a less
    rare noisy-degrade. Bounded in practice because git rewrites config atomically
    (lock + rename), so only a non-git tool truncating in place can produce it.

    Returns the value RAW and undecoded — `core.worktree` is a path — so callers test
    presence with `is not None`, never truthiness. See the call sites for why.

def _shared_repository_is_private(value: str) -> bool:
    """Does `core.sharedRepository = value` leave the repository private to its owner?

    git's parse, mirrored (`setup.c::git_config_perm`): the keyword `umask` and the
    false booleans are private, `group`/`all`/`world`/`everybody` and the true
    booleans are not, and an octal value is a FILEMODE with the legacy 0/1/2
    special-cased ahead of it.

    For a filemode git masks the value with 0666, so private is `& 0066 == 0` — NOT
    "no execute bits" and NOT "equals 0600". `0711` IS private, because the mask
    discards the execute bits; `0755` is NOT, because its group/other READ bits
    survive it. Those two cases are why this is a mask test and not a literal set.

    `(mode & 0600) != 0600` is git's own `die()` condition, so such a value reaches
    us only in a repository git already refuses to operate on. It stays off the
    accept side with every other value git rejects.

    THE PATTERN IS DELIBERATELY STRICTER THAN `strtol`, in the refusing direction.
    git accepts leading whitespace and a leading `+` (`+0600` is private to git)
    which `[0-7]+` refuses — a false refusal, which this gate is contracted to
    prefer. Strictness in the other direction is the load-bearing half: Python's
    `int(value, 8)` accepts `0o600` and `0_600`, which git REJECTS, so parsing with
    Python's own rules would accept a repository git cannot open.

    THE EMPTY STRING IS EXCLUDED ON PURPOSE, and the `+` quantifier is what excludes
    it. `strtol("")` converts nothing, leaves `*end == 0` and yields 0, so git reads
    an explicitly empty value as PERM_UMASK, i.e. private. It is refused anyway,
    because `--get` answers an empty value and a VALUELESS `sharedRepository` line

def _shield_shared_repository(worktree: Path, common_dir: Path) -> str | None:
    """Refuse a repository configured to be SHARED BETWEEN OS USERS, else None.

    A repository shared between OS users is not a supported configuration
    (maintainer decision, #384): the shield creates files of its own inside `.git`,
    and making those work across OS users is out of scope. Refusing up front fails
    LOUDLY and identically for every user — journaled and notified — rather than
    behaving differently depending on who provisioned first.

    The gate runs ABOVE the shield's lock, so nothing is created in a shared
    repository at all. That is safe here and would not be for
    `extensions.worktreeConfig`: this key is static configuration the tool never
    writes, so there is no shared mutable state to serialize. It adds no version
    floor either — a plain `--get` with no `--type=`. `--type=` was itself a reason to
    keep the version gate above the probes when the gate was 2.20; at `GIT_FLOOR` it
    is far below the floor, and the gate leads for its unreadable-answer arm instead
    (see `_shield_enable_worktree_config`).

    AN ALLOWLIST, NOT AN ENUMERATION OF SHARED SHAPES: git accepts keywords,
    booleans, the legacy 0/1/2 and bare octal modes, so enumerating the shared ones
    leaves every value git adds later — and every value git rejects — silently
    opening the gate. Values git rejects really do reach here, since `rev-parse
    --absolute-git-dir` answers rc 0 for every one of them, `banana` included; the
    "it would have fatalled earlier" reasoning that fits other probes in this file
    does not hold. They fall off the allowlist deliberately: such a repository is
    already unusable (`git status` exits 128), so refusing costs nothing while
    guessing at a malformed value would.

    AN EMPTY VALUE AND A VALUELESS `sharedRepository` LINE ARE INDISTINGUISHABLE AND
    MEAN OPPOSITE THINGS: explicitly empty is PERM_UMASK (private), a valueless line
    is PERM_GROUP (shared), and `--get` answers both rc 0 with a lone b"\\n". Nothing
    separates them, so the empty answer REFUSES — a false refusal is a reported skip,
    a false accept is the bug this gate prevents.

    `removesuffix("\\n")`, NEVER `.strip()`: `--get` returns edge whitespace VERBATIM
    (a quoted `" umask"` comes back as b" umask\\n"), so stripping would widen a value
    git itself rejects straight into the accept set below. The case handling is
    asymmetric because git's is — keywords compared with strcmp, booleans with
    strcasecmp — so `FALSE` and `Off` are accepted while `UMASK` and `GROUP` are
    values git REJECTS.

    SCOPE, NARROWER THAN GIT'S OWN RESOLUTION: the read names the repository's
    SHARED CONFIG. git honors `core.sharedRepository` from a GLOBAL config too, so
    an operator's global setting is not consulted here and such a repository is
    still shielded — deliberately, since a global preference is not a statement that
    THIS repository is shared. What is refused is a repository CONFIGURED as shared,
    the shape `git init --shared` writes (`--shared=group` records the legacy
    `sharedrepository = 1`).

    WORKTREE SCOPE is unread too, and git DOES honor `core.sharedRepository` from a
    linked worktree's own `config.worktree`, which the `--file` read below answers
    rc 1 for. What makes that unreachable is the provisioning flow rather than
    anything here: the shield only ever runs on a worktree this process just created
    (`workspace.open_unit_workspace` -> `verify.worktree_add` ->
    `worktree_flow.provision_worktree`), `git worktree add` creates the admin dir
    with NO `config.worktree`, a re-mount prunes `.git/worktrees/<id>` whole, the
    MAIN worktree's `.git/config.worktree` does not reach a linked one, and the
    tree's only worktree-scoped write is the shield's own `core.excludesFile`. So
    the value has no writer and no window. If a re-provision path onto an EXISTING
    worktree is ever added, or anything upstream starts writing the unit worktree's
    config, this read must grow a second `--file <git_dir>/config.worktree` probe in
    the same change.

    and the caller must still set `extensions.worktreeConfig` itself; False when the
    repo already carries it (or when `reason` is set and nothing may be written).

    Answering is split from writing because enabling the extension is a PERMANENT
    repo-format change: performed here it precedes the seed, the write and the
    activation, so any degrade below it left the repo marked for a shield that never
    applied. The caller enables it immediately before the activation and rolls the
    flag back when the shield then fails to hold — including when the ENABLE ITSELF
    fails in a way that leaves the outcome unknown. The flag outlives a failed
    shield only where the rollback was DECLINED because a sibling worktree depends
    on it, or could not be made at all; the reason says which.

    `extensions.worktreeConfig` is what makes a per-worktree config file exist at
    all; without it `git config --worktree` either refuses outright (a repo with
    linked worktrees) or silently writes the SHARED config.

    Enabling it is refused in the two shapes git-worktree(1) (CONFIGURATION FILE)
    calls out: with `core.bare = true` or `core.worktree` in the shared config,
    enabling drops the exception that confines those keys to the main worktree, so
    they would start applying to every worktree. Git's remedy is a repo-layout edit
    the installer will not make behind an operator's back, so the shield degrades
    instead.

    It is refused a THIRD way, which is this project's rather than git's: an
    `extensions.worktreeConfig` already PRESENT but not `true` is an operator's
    explicit disable, and enabling over it would rewrite that declaration
    permanently — the same discipline as above, applied to the flag itself (#396).

    The version gate and the refusal probes STAY HERE, first. The gate is the
    PROJECT support floor (`verify.GIT_FLOOR`), not a capability threshold of this
    shield's own: `extensions.worktreeConfig` and `git config --worktree` arrived in
    git 2.20 and `--type=` in 2.18, all well below the floor, so on any supported git
    every probe below can answer. Refusing an unsupported git is therefore a POLICY
    decision, not a capability one — the enable is a permanent repo-format change,
    and git-worktree(1) says older git refuses a repository carrying the extension,
    so a git this project neither tests nor supports is exactly the one to withhold
    that write from. `_shield_shared_config`'s raise on any rc but 0 or 1 is defence
    in depth BEHIND this gate, not licence to relax it. The caller's `--type=path`
    excludesFile read rests on it too.

    The run, sweep and resume entrypoints already refuse an under-floor git outright
    (`cli._reject_under_floor_git`), so no supported path reaches this gate with one.
    It stays because its OTHER arm still fires on a perfectly current host: a git
    that cannot be spawned, times out, or answers unparseably reads as below the
    floor, and none of those may authorize the write.

    Returns `""` when the repository is back in the state it was found in, or a
    clause naming the fault otherwise — never raises: every caller is already
    reporting a degrade, and this says what it could not undo.

    Callers MUST gate this on having enabled the flag themselves, or on not having
    been able to FIND OUT whether they did — which is what the enable's own raise
    means. Unsetting one the repository already carried would stop git reading the
    `config.worktree` files other worktrees may depend on, so the rollback is
    conditional, never unconditional cleanup.

    That caller-side gate is necessary and NOT sufficient (#384): `needs_enable`
    records what the PROBE saw, and the enable is an idempotent rc-0 no-op against a
    flag already `true`, so two concurrent provisionings that both probed an absent
    flag both believe they own it, and whichever one's activation fails would unset a
    flag the other's LIVE shield depends on — leaving its tool files stageable
    mid-run. The caller serializes the transaction under a repository lock, but a lock
    binds only its holders: an operator, an older bmad-loop, or `git sparse-checkout`
    can set the same flag outside it.

    EXCLUDING OUR OWN `git_dir` IS LOAD-BEARING: a `config.worktree` there is the
    half-written product of the very activation whose failure prompted this rollback
    (a timeout can leave one behind), so counting it as a dependent would suppress
    the rollback.

    WHAT IT DOES NOT COVER: a non-lock-taking party between its own enable and its
    own activation owns the flag while having written nothing yet, so the scan cannot
    see it and this rollback unsets it. Bounded — its `git config --worktree` then
    fatals for want of the extension (rc 128 — a sibling exists by construction here;
    in a single-worktree repo `--worktree` instead exits 0 and writes the SHARED
    config), so its shield degrades with a REPORTED reason rather than going silently
    inert. The opposite error is accepted too: a stale admin dir git has not pruned yet

      on. The caller's `is_file()` seeds nothing, which mirrors that exactly.
    - a DIRECTORY passes that same `access(R_OK)` gate, so git goes on to
      `add_patterns_from_file_1` and `die("cannot use %s as an exclude file")`. Git
      does not run at all, and an empty seed would model a FATAL as a permissive
      success — see `_shield_home_git_ignore`, which refuses that shape.

    """`$HOME/.config/git/ignore` — git's XDG fallback — asked of GIT, not of Python.

    `Path.home()` is the obvious spelling and it is WRONG on Windows, the one
    platform where git's home and Python's are derived differently. Git locates this
    fallback with `getenv("HOME")` everywhere (`path.c::xdg_config_home`), but on
    Windows `compat/mingw.c::setup_windows_environment()` DERIVES `HOME` inside the
    git process first, preferring `HOMEDRIVE`+`HOMEPATH` (only when that names a real
    directory) over `USERPROFILE`; Python's `ntpath.expanduser` has the OPPOSITE
    precedence and never consults `HOME` at all. Git Bash and MSYS2 set `HOME`; a
    domain-joined machine's `HOMEDRIVE`+`HOMEPATH` may be a network home share.
    Either makes the two disagree.

    The miss is SILENT, and it is #384's own harm through the platform split: the
    wrong path is simply not a file, the seed comes back empty, and the caller's
    activation then SHADOWS the global ignore file git really reads.

    So ask git. `--type=path` interpolates a leading `~/` through the same
    `getenv("HOME")` git uses for the fallback itself, so the answer is correct by
    construction on every platform and names no environment variable. `-c` is COMMAND
    scope, the most specific git has, so the probe's value cannot be outranked by the
    operator's config. The answer comes back NUL-terminated at rc 0; with `HOME`
    unset git exits 128 and applies no fallback at all.

    That `$HOME` answer is the whole of the fallback UPSTREAM, and is not on **Git
    for Windows >= 2.46** (#403). The fork patches `xdg_config_home_for`
    (`git-for-windows/git`, `path.c`) to prefer `%APPDATA%/Git/<file>` whenever that
    file EXISTS, warning that it ignored the `$HOME` one when both are there. Counted
    per tag: present at 2.46.0.windows.1 and 2.55.0.windows.3, absent at
    2.45.0.windows.1 and 2.20.0.windows.1, absent from upstream `git/git` entirely.
    PROVENANCE: source-read through #403, **NOT measured on a Windows machine** — no
    runtime observation of Git for Windows was available, and Windows CI cannot supply
    one either (the runners carry no `%APPDATA%\\Git\\ignore`, so they can show only
    that nothing broke).

    The APPDATA arm below closes a harm that ran in BOTH directions, each silent.
    APPDATA file only: this returned a `$HOME` path that is typically not a file, the
    seed came back empty with `reason is None`, and the caller then activated a
    worktree-scoped `core.excludesFile` SHADOWING the file git really reads — so
    everything the operator globally ignores became visible to `git add -A` and swept
    into the story commit. BOTH files present: git uses the APPDATA one and says so,
    while this seeded the `$HOME` one — copying patterns git is not applying, so the
    worktree OVER-ignored and session-created files went silently missing instead.

    Raises `GitError` on any non-zero rc, INCLUDING the `HOME`-unset one. Proceeding
    would be a guess, and a guess here is silent: the caller seeds nothing and
    activates over whatever git does read. git's message is deliberately NOT matched
    to tell "no HOME" apart from a transient fault, because that wording is
    version-dependent. A `HOME`-less environment therefore skips the shield with a
    reported reason; only a definite absent may be silent in this caller.

    """The BYTES of whatever `core.excludesFile` this worktree resolves to now.

    A worktree-scoped `core.excludesFile` SHADOWS the operator's own: git reads the
    key from the most specific scope that sets it, never concatenating scopes. Not
    carrying their patterns over would un-ignore, inside the worktree, everything
    they ignore globally — and `git add -A` would commit it. The caller seeds once,
    at creation, so the copy never fights later edits to the private file.

    BYTES, never decoded text: exclude entries are path patterns, POSIX paths are
    arbitrary bytes, and one non-UTF-8 byte collapsed a `read_text` seed to empty —
    after which the activation SHADOWED what it failed to copy. Copying verbatim
    also keeps every pattern intact for the caller's dedupe; git reads the result
    either way, stripping a trailing `\\r` from an exclude line and skipping a
    UTF-8 BOM.

    FOUR outcomes (#384). The first two are silent; the other two RAISE, and the
    caller's tail turns that into the degrade reason that skips the activation.

    - ABSENT is silent, empty, and the ONLY outcome that falls back: `--get` of an
      unset key exits 1, and `is_file()` false says the fallback file is not there.
      Reaching that fallback can itself fail — `_shield_home_git_ignore` raises, and
      an unresolvable home is UNKNOWN, not absent.
    - DISABLED is silent and empty too, and is NOT absent. An explicitly EMPTY
      `core.excludesFile` means "no excludes file at all", and git honors that
      literally: `-z --get` answers rc 0 with a lone NUL, git loads no patterns, and
      does NOT reach for XDG (`dir.c` guards that fallback on a NULL `excludes_file`;
      an empty value is not NULL — unchanged across the supported range to master).
      Reading it as unset instead seeds and activates the XDG file's patterns —
      OVER-ignoring, so files the operator deliberately stopped ignoring go silently
      missing from `git add -A`.
    - PRESENT BUT UNREADABLE propagates: a read `OSError` (EACCES, EIO) reaches the
      caller's degrade arm — activating over patterns that could not be copied
      shadows them exactly as an empty seed did.
    - UNKNOWN propagates too, in TWO shapes: a raised `GitError`, and any returncode
      that is neither 0 nor 1. A fault means we did not FIND OUT; swallowing it maps
      UNKNOWN onto ABSENT and activates a key shadowing the file it failed to read.

def _shield_verify_activation(worktree: Path, exclude: Path) -> str | None:
    """Why the just-written `core.excludesFile` is NOT the one git reads, or None.

    A successful `git config --worktree core.excludesFile` proves the value was
    WRITTEN, not that it is in FORCE. git resolves the key from the most specific
    scope that carries it, and `command` — a scope fed by the ENVIRONMENT the
    orchestrator was launched with — outranks `worktree`. So an operator carrying an
    ambient `core.excludesFile` gets a shield that reports success and whose private
    file is never read: the provisioned tool files stay stageable by the unit's
    `git add -A`, with no degrade reason to journal. The check has git NAME the winning
    scope rather than leaving it inferred from the value that came back.

    So the post-condition is asked of git. Detecting the ORIGIN instead —
    `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT` and friends in `os.environ` — is the enumeration this function
    exists to avoid, and `--show-scope` strengthens that argument rather than retiring
    it: nothing here reads `os.environ`, and git folds the whole channel family into
    the single token `command` on the same single call, so every channel — and whatever
    git adds next — arrives already LABELED, and the degrade reason names the family
    without this code enumerating it. The evidence for why enumerating was never viable
    stands: `GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS` is carried in two mutually incompatible encodings
    across the supported range, `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT` is one more channel to remember (it
    sits below `GIT_FLOOR`, so it is always present and always another thing to read),
    and a `git -c` on a session's own command line never appears in our environment at
    all. Asking git what it RESOLVED costs one call and covers all of them.

    `--show-scope` is git 2.26, which was above the old 2.20 gate this shield used to
    carry; at `GIT_FLOOR` it is present on every supported git, which is what unblocked
    it (#692). Under `-z` the answer is `scope NUL value NUL` — measured at BOTH ends of
    the supported range, git 2.34.1 (the floor itself) and git 2.55.0, where the flag
    also leaves the rc taxonomy alone: an absent key is still rc 1 with or without it.
    The scope tokens git documents are `system`, `global`, `local`, `worktree` and
    `command`. The scope refines the MESSAGE and nothing else: a byte-identical value
    returns None whatever scope supplied it, since the post-condition is that git reads
    the file we wrote and provenance is not a fault; every mismatch degrades; the scope
    only decides what the reason tells the operator to go looking for.

    The read shape is the seed read's: `-z` because a legal POSIX path may carry edge
    whitespace, `--type=path` because that is how git itself resolves the key. Any
    non-zero rc is a fault here, not an ABSENT answer — this call asks about a key we
    have just written, so "there is no such key" is not good news about it. That is a
    DIFFERENT taxonomy from `_shield_inherited_excludes`, which reads a key the
    operator may never have set; the two must not be unified. rc 0 carries a fault of
    its own now: a well-formed `-z --show-scope` answer always holds the seam NUL
    between scope and value, so an answer without one is not an answer and degrades
    fail-closed rather than being parsed as a scope. Whatever shape an unmeasured git
    might return lands there or in the unknown-token branch, and both degrade. The two
    reads are also no longer byte-identical in ARGV — `--show-scope` is on this one
    alone, retiring a trap the tests documented — and the seed read must NOT grow it,
    since rc 1 there means ABSENT.

    The comparison is byte-exact and stays that way: `git config` round-trips a path
    verbatim through every hazard this shield has been burned by — edge whitespace,
    an embedded newline, a non-UTF-8 byte, an interior `~` — so loosening it would
    buy nothing and could only mask a real mismatch.

    """Shield the just-provisioned tool files from the unit's `git add -A`, in a
    private exclude scoped to THIS worktree.

    SCOPE — the patterns land in `<worktree gitdir>/info/exclude`, activated by
    `git config --worktree core.excludesFile`. Git's only per-repo exclude is
    `$GIT_COMMON_DIR/info/exclude`, so the private file is inert without that key,
    which applies it to this worktree alone — main checkout and siblings untouched.

    LIFETIME — `git worktree remove`/`prune` deletes the per-worktree gitdir, taking
    the exclude and the `config.worktree` pointing at it: the shield expires with
    what it shields.

    The repository-wide `.git/info/exclude` is NEVER written again on any path
    (#384): a refusal SKIPS the shield rather than falling back to it.

    PRICE — `extensions.worktreeConfig` is repo-wide format state a successful shield
    leaves permanently enabled, and git older than 2.20 refuses to access a repository
    carrying it (git-worktree(1)). It is enabled at the LAST possible moment,
    immediately before the activation. The ACTIVATION rolls it back on a non-zero rc,
    on a raise, and on a write that succeeded without taking effect
    (`_shield_verify_activation`); the ENABLE only on the raise, since an rc means git
    declined to write and an unset would remove a concurrent writer's flag. Both are
    gated on this call having set the flag and no sibling worktree depending on it
    (`_shield_undo_extension`).

    Every git call goes through `verify.git_bytes`: the returncode is an ANSWER, not
    a raise, and stdout arrives as BYTES.

    Best-effort in two arms, separate because a fault means the opposite in each:

    - git unqueryable BEFORE GIT HAS ANSWERED AT ALL (not a repo, git missing, a
      timeout or spawn failure on the FIRST `rev-parse` — both `GitError`) is an
      EXPECTED skip: returns None silently. That scope is the whole of it, and
      nothing is DECODED in this arm — git's stdout stays bytes until the tail
      below, because a decode fault is a degrade, not this arm's silent skip (#374).
    - anything AFTER git answered degrades to a returned reason string; only a
      definite ABSENT answer stays silent. Silence is not cosmetic: without the
      exclude the unit's `git add -A` commits the tool files just provisioned.

    The exclude PAYLOAD is bytes end-to-end, so the tail's `UnicodeError` has two
    sources: `os.fsdecode` of git's stdout, Windows-only (#374/#377), and
    `os.fsencode` of a pattern carrying a surrogate POSIX surrogateescape never
