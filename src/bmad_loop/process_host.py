"""Cross-platform process-lifecycle primitives behind a single seam.

The orchestrator needs four operations on a pid it launched: politely stop it,
force-kill it when it ignores that, check whether it is still alive, and — to
guard against pid reuse before a force-kill — read a stable per-process identity.
On POSIX these are ``os.kill`` calls; on Windows they are ``taskkill`` / psutil.
Quarantining them behind :class:`ProcessHost` lets a native-Windows backend slot
in as a new subclass + one registration line, with no edits to the POSIX bodies
or to the callers (`runs.stop_run`, the TUI liveness column).

On Linux/macOS — and WSL, which *is* Linux — these preserve today's exact
behavior; the Windows branch degrades gracefully and is not yet exercised (no
Windows backend ships in this pass). Selection mirrors the multiplexer registry
in :mod:`bmad_loop.adapters.multiplexer`.

    create_time(fast_only=True)``); the ``LINUX or NETBSD or OSX`` branch binds a
