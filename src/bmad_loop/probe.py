"""`bmad-loop probe-adapter`: collect + sanitize adapter-finalization data.

Finalizing a generic-adapter CLI profile needs facts that live in no doc: the
CLI's exact hook payload shape (field names/casing, whether transcript_path /
session_id / cwd are present), where its transcript lives and in what format,
and the token-usage schema a `usage_parser` must read. This command pulls all of
that and runs it through the audited :mod:`bmad_loop.sanitize` chokepoint, so a
user of any coding CLI can run one command and paste back a clean, content-free
report.

Two strategies, one report shape:

- SCAN (default, zero process launch beyond ``--version``/``--help``): locate the
  newest already-existing transcript by convention, read the declared hook config,
  infer the token schema. Works whenever the user has used the CLI before.
- PROBE (``--probe``, opt-in): in an ephemeral ``mkdtemp`` workspace, register the
  full-payload capture hook for every native event, launch one trivial content-free
  turn in a tmux window, capture each event's complete payload, then tear down. The
  raw capture exists only transiently inside the temp dir, which is ``rmtree``'d in a
  ``finally`` (even on exception / Ctrl-C).

One finding, two render targets: :func:`render_markdown` for the human report
(the CLI default) and :func:`render_json` for the machine-readable document that
``--json`` emits instead (the :mod:`bmad_loop.machine` contract — one object on
stdout, nothing else). The document carries :data:`SCHEMA_VERSION` as a top-level
``schema_version``; do not confuse it with the document's ``version`` key, which
holds the *probed CLI's* own ``--version`` output.

Safety model — the same two layers as :mod:`bmad_loop.diagnostics` (closed by
#199). Captured data is scrubbed/reduced at COLLECTION time (captured payloads
ship as key-path:type *schema*, never values; paths are per-component redacted
with the project basename routed through a :class:`sanitize.Pseudonymizer`
alias), and both renderers run :func:`sanitize.guard` over their own rendered
bytes before returning — a hard-rule hit (email/secret/home-path/url-creds/
username) refuses to emit, while a stray occurrence of a registered alias
original is repaired, re-verified, and disclosed. The residual is stated
honestly: identifier-shaped proprietary values the probe cannot know about
(an arbitrary slug in a dynamic key, say) match no hard rule and no registered
extra, so the guard cannot see them — which is why collection reduces payloads
to shape instead of trying to enumerate what might be sensitive.

    while every launch of it fails (#294) — so ``validate`` reported OK on an
    install that could not start a session. Running the binary once is the only
    thing that separates the two.

    Never raises, and that is load-bearing rather than defensive style: machine.py

    the return is deliberately left as bytes (no ``text=True``): nothing here reads
    the output, so the locale decode that forced ``errors="replace"`` on that
    function never happens and cannot raise the ``UnicodeDecodeError`` the guard
    does not name.

    None (could not launch, or timed out) and a nonzero code are separate answers
