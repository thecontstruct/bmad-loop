"""Deterministic reading and editing of the deferred-work ledger.

The ledger (`{implementation_artifacts}/deferred-work.md`) is append-only
markdown in the canonical form documented at
bmad-loop-sweep/deferred-work-format.md: `### DW-<seq>: <title>` headings with
`origin:`/`location:`/`reason:`/`status:` field lines. The one sanctioned
rewrite is :func:`archive_closed`, which moves closed entries verbatim to a
sibling archive file and leaves id-preserving stubs. Pre-#2651 dev primitives
and the attended `bmad-build` append flatter entries here directly, which the
orchestrator normalizes on sweep; the current unattended primitive records its
findings in the spec's frontmatter instead and the engine harvests them into
canonical entries. The
orchestrator never trusts an LLM to have edited it — status flips and decision
records happen here, and gates re-read the file from disk.

Concurrency (#286/#469): every mutator below is a read->edit->write of the whole
file, so two orchestrator processes — a second `bmad-loop run`, a run plus a
sweep, a run plus the TUI decision modal, a run plus `sweep --archive` — would
otherwise both read, both edit, and let the last atomic write win. Each leaf
mutator therefore runs its whole read->edit->write under :func:`ledger_lock`, a
cross-process mutex on an out-of-repo sidecar. Readers stay lock-free on
purpose: every writer replaces the file atomically, so a reader already sees one
whole version or another, and taking the lock to read would buy nothing while
adding a way to deadlock. Out of scope by #286's own non-goals: the dev/review
LLM session writes this file directly and does NOT take the lock — orchestrator
writes are sequenced against sessions today, so the exposure this closes is
orchestrator-vs-orchestrator.

What the hold covers is every read that decides the PUBLISHED BYTES, which is
not quite every read (#736). A mutator handed work that turns out to be a no-op
— ids that are all already done, a decision on an entry that is not there,
specs that all dedupe, nothing eligible to archive — may answer from ONE
advisory read taken before the lock, running the same pure decision helper the
locked pass runs so the two cannot drift. Only a "would write nothing" answer
is acted on, and such a call linearizes at the probe read: it publishes no
bytes, so there is nothing for a rival to interleave with. Every other answer,
and any fault during the probe, falls through to the hold, which re-reads and
decides authoritatively. This is what keeps a no-op from failing on a lock it
never needed — an `OSError` from acquisition, or a
:class:`~bmad_loop.runs.StateRootError` from deriving the sidecar path where no
state root exists — which a replayed rollback, a re-run sweep and
``sweep --archive`` all reach routinely.

# the first and can never match `gates_story` against any legal key, so it used to
# report a green `ok` while gating nothing — the field's own silent no-op, one
# keystroke away from the shape that works.
#
# Two arms, because BMAD spells a story key two ways and they are NOT
# interchangeable. A stories-mode id is alphanumeric segments joined by single
# dashes (`_STORIES_ID_RE`), so `3.2` and `3_2` are out. A sprint key's slug is
# unconstrained (`sprintstatus.STORY_RE`'s trailing group), so `3-2-foo.bar` and

# whole-token shape test and not a ban on `.`/`_`. Only those characters in the
# *number* prefix are unmatchable; banning them outright would refuse real gates.
#
# Sound in the direction that matters: a token matching either arm is itself a

    boundary is required rather than a bare ``startswith`` so ``3-2`` cannot sweep
    in its numeric neighbours: ``3-20-later`` is a different story.

    Two boundaries count, because BMAD spells a story key two ways. The plain one
    is ``-``. The other is a **split**: ``sprintstatus.STORY_RE`` lets an oversized
    story become ``3-2a-...`` / ``3-2b-...`` at breakdown time, and a token that

    ``-`` after it is required, so ``3-2ab-x`` and a bare ``3-2a`` are not swept in.

    The split arm applies only to a token that *is* a bare ``<epic>-<story>``,
    because that is the only place a split letter can attach: ``STORY_RE`` puts it

    admits word ids, so ``gate: auth`` refused ``authz-login``, and a hard failure
    on an unrelated story is the one way this check can be worse than the prose it
    replaced. "Ends in a digit" is the same guard written too loosely: the digit
    can belong to a *slug*, so ``gate: 3-2-v2`` took the arm and refused
    ``3-2-v2a-followup`` — a different, legal key — and ``gate: 3`` refused the

    The whole of the #305 fix. These writers interpolate their arguments into a
    line-oriented file, so a value carrying a break mints a phantom
    `### DW-<n>` entry, truncates the entry's span at :data:`FLAT_ENTRY_RE` and
    re-surfaces the tail as a legacy item, or leaves the entry carrying two
    `status:` lines.

    Note what the last shape does *not* do: `STATUS_RE` takes the first match, so
    an injected `status:` never changes what `parse_ledger` reports. A test that
    asserts on `entry.status` therefore passes with this guard deleted — the
    observable is the line structure.

    Sanitizes; never raises, and nothing upstream rejects on a break either. The
    close paths call these writers bare (`sweep._close_resolved`,
    `decisions.apply_pre_answer`), so a `ValueError` would end the sweep as
    crashed; refusing the same text back at `validate_triage` only moved the
    stoppage to a pause. Collapsing is lossless enough — the ledger wants one
    line anyway — so this is the fix, and the skill docs are guidance that
    reduces occurrences without gating on them.

    That contract covers one hazard more than the break collapse alone, which is
    what the `neutralize_surrogates` pass in front of it buys (#329). A lone
    surrogate is not a line break, so it sailed through untouched — but it has
    no UTF-8 encoding, and `atomic_write_text`'s strict encode raises
    `UnicodeEncodeError` (a `ValueError` subclass) on it, from inside those same
    bare close-path calls. It arrives the way the break did: a triage
    `result.json` is cached with `json.dumps`, whose `ensure_ascii` keeps the
    code point a harmless `\\ud800` escape, and the reload's `json.loads` revives
    the real thing into `ResolvedEntry.evidence` and on into the `mark_done`
    note. Refusing it upstream would only move the stoppage again — same
    doctrine, same answer.

    A value with neither a break nor a surrogate is returned **untouched**, so an
    existing ledger is never reformatted and a clean write is byte-identical to
    before the guard; each pass keeps its own fast path, so the common value is
    scanned twice and copied never. The trailing `.strip()` removes all
    surrounding whitespace, not merely the space a leading or trailing break left
    behind — which is why it must stay on the far side of that fast path.

    A break-only value therefore sanitizes to `""`. Keeping it non-empty *here*
    could only yield bare whitespace, which trades an unfindable entry for an
    unidentifiable one, so each caller handles its own empties — and by two
    different strategies, which is why neither belongs in this helper.
    :func:`append_entry` **substitutes**, naming a vanished title
    `(untitled DW-<n>)` so the id it just burned stays findable.
    :func:`append_decision` **drops**, shedding the ` — ` separator along with an
    empty detail rather than promising one that is not there. Its `label` needs
    neither: every member of :data:`LINE_BREAK_RE` is `str.isspace()`, and
    `validate_triage` builds each `DecisionOption` with `.strip() or key`, so a
    break-only label has already become the option key before it arrives.

    A surrogate-only value, by contrast, sanitizes to a truthy `"�"`, so neither
    caller's empty-handling fires for it. That is the point of replacing rather
    than stripping: a title reading `�` still says *something unencodable was
    here*, where a vanished one would silently become `(untitled DW-<n>)`."""

    says open.

    The decision line is inserted BEFORE the close is applied, which is not a
    preference: :func:`_apply_done` writes its `resolution:` line immediately
    after the status line, and :data:`_MARK_DONE_TAIL_RE` — what
    :func:`_apply_open` matches an undo marker with — anchors on exactly that
    adjacency. Applying the close first would leave the decision line between
    status and resolution and make a reopenable close unreopenable. Ordered this
    way the bytes are identical to the serial pair's.

    An already-done (or missing-status) entry skips only the close half: the
    decision line still lands, because a decision recorded on an entry someone
    else already closed is still what the human chose. `close_note` is the
    resolution note for the flip, distinct from `detail`, which is the decision's
    own rationale.

    Precondition: `date` is ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` — one check for both halves, since
    the decision line and the close share it; anything else raises `ValueError`,
    checked before the ``is_file`` short-circuit so an absent ledger cannot hide
    the bug.

    A missing ledger, and a `dw_id` no entry carries, are both answered False

    For a caller that has to record WHAT IT WROTE rather than what the file holds
    afterwards. Reading the ledger back after this returns is a different
    question with the same answer only when nobody else wrote in between: the
    lock is released before the read, so a concurrent mutator's bytes would be
    folded into the caller's own anchor. That matters for
    ``post_engine_ledger_digest``, whose whole job is to say "these bytes are
    ours" — counting a rival's write as ours would have the pre-harvest restore
    retract it, which is the loss this module exists to prevent (#286). Taking
    the text from inside the hold removes the window rather than narrowing it.

    The returned text is what was handed to
    :func:`~bmad_loop.platform_util.atomic_write_text`, so a digest of it equals
    a digest of a later ``read_text`` of the file: the writer's text mode
    translates the newlines on the way out and ``read_text`` normalizes them back
    on the way in.

    ONE locked read->edit->write: the whole cycle runs under the cross-process
    ledger lock (#286/#469), so concurrent mutators — a second run, a sweep, the
    TUI decision modal, ``sweep --archive`` — serialize here rather than trading
    last-write-wins. The hold spans every `next_seq` mint as well as every
    idempotence scan, which is what stops two concurrent appenders reading the
    same highest id and both minting it (#469).

    Byte-identical to a serial :func:`append_entry` loop over the same specs,
    because each spec is applied to the text the previous one produced rather
    than to the text this call read. That is what a naive batch gets wrong: minted
    against the original text, every spec in one call would claim the same id.

    ALL specs are validated — the `status` and `severity` enumerations, which are
    orchestrator-owned and so raise rather than sanitize — before the lock is
    taken and before anything is written. All-or-nothing: a bad spec anywhere in
    the sequence leaves the ledger exactly as it was, rather than committing the
    prefix that happened to precede it. Validating above the lock also means a
    programmer bug reports itself without first waiting on another process.

    Nothing is written when every spec dedupes, and no lock is taken either
    (#736): a replayed defer is answered from one advisory read that runs
    :func:`_apply_appends`, the same helper the locked pass runs, so it leaves
    the file untouched rather than rewriting it byte-for-byte. Deliberately NO
    missing-ledger guard, unlike its sibling mutators: an absent ledger here
    means CREATE, which is a write, and a write must take the lock.

    The write goes through :func:`~bmad_loop.platform_util.atomic_write_text` for
    the reasons documented on :func:`mark_done_many`, plus one this sibling shares
    with it: a bare ``Path.write_text`` truncates *before* it encodes, so any
    failure between the two — an unencodable value, ``ENOSPC``, ``EIO`` — leaves a
    zero-byte ledger where every entry used to be (#328).
