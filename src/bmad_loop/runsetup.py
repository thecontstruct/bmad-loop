"""Run-composition layer for the CLI's ``run`` callback.

``cli.cmd_run`` used to build the :class:`~bmad_loop.model.RunState`, wire the
:class:`~bmad_loop.engine.Engine`, and stand up the coding-CLI adapters inline in
an argparse callback — logic that could only be exercised by round-tripping
through argv. This module lifts those pieces out as typed functions so a non-CLI
frontend (or a test) can compose a run directly:

* :func:`make_adapters` — the per-role adapter factory.
* :func:`platform_preflight` — the multiplexer/process-host readiness probe
  ``cmd_validate`` reports.
* :func:`build_run_state` / :func:`compose_run` — the RunState + Engine wiring
  for ``cmd_run``.
* :func:`compose_sweep` — the same wiring for a ``sweep`` run (``cmd_sweep`` and
  the auto-triggered child-sweep factory).
* :func:`compose_resume` — rebuilds the engine for a paused/interrupted run
  (``cmd_resume`` and ``resolve``'s re-arm), selecting the sweep/stories/plain
  variant from persisted run state.

The engine class and the adapter factory are *injected* into :func:`compose_run`
rather than referenced here directly: ``cli`` resolves ``Engine`` /
``StoriesEngine`` / ``_make_adapters`` from its own module namespace at call time,
so the test suite's ``monkeypatch.setattr(cli, "Engine", ...)`` (and friends)
still bites. ``cli`` re-exports :func:`make_adapters`, :func:`platform_preflight`,
:func:`mux_reason_label`, and :data:`ROLES` under their historical private names
so those seams stay importable and monkeypatchable from ``cli``.

    ``state`` arrives already re-stamped and persisted by the caller: the resume
    policy-snapshot reconciliation and the pause/pid/graceful-stop bookkeeping stay
    CLI-side (their ordering is load-bearing — see ``_resume_paused_run``), so this
    lifts only the composition. The variant is selected from persisted run state:
    ``run_type == "sweep"`` rebuilds a ``SweepEngine`` from ``sweep.json``;
    otherwise ``source`` picks ``StoriesEngine`` vs ``Engine``, restoring the
    launching scope + cap so a resumed ``--epic N`` run keeps its filter. The engine
    classes and ``make_adapters`` are injected so ``cli``'s ``monkeypatch.setattr``
    seams bite."""
