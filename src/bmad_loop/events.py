"""Importable twin of the hardened event write in ``data/bmad_loop_hook.py``.

The hook script is COPIED into every target project and runs inside the coding
CLI's process under whatever interpreter the host has, so it is stdlib-only by
contract (its docstring says so) and cannot import ``bmad_loop`` to reach this
module — and this module cannot import it back, since it ships as package DATA
rather than as an importable module. Hence a twin rather than shared code:
``_LINK_REPARSE_TAGS``, ``_first_workspace``, ``_is_link_like``, ``_write_all``
and ``_write_event`` below are byte-identical copies of the hook's, pinned that
way by ``tests/test_events.py::test_the_twinned_source_is_identical`` — which
AST-extracts both sides and compares the source segments, so a fix applied to one
writer of the events control plane and not the other cannot pass review silently.

Because they are byte-identical, their docstrings and comments are written from
the hook script's vantage point ("this relay runs under whatever interpreter the
host has") and stay that way on purpose: rewording either side to suit its own
file breaks parity, and diverging is exactly what two separately-hardened writers
of one control plane must not do. What the shared text says about the attack, the
platform branches, and the residual Windows windows holds for both.

The rest of the module is this side's own: the payload shaping the hook does
inline in its ``main()``, and :func:`relay`, which backs ``bmad-loop relay
<Event>`` — the #461 Phase 2 hook target, an installed console script instead of
a file path inside the workspace that a branch switch can take away.

    The events dir is the orchestrator's control plane. A driven session has
    write access to the project, so it could plant `<run_dir>/events` as a
    symlink (or, on Windows, a junction) and redirect — or swallow — the
    completion signal, stalling the run to `session_timeout_min` instead of
    completing. `os.makedirs(exist_ok=True)` `isdir()`-checks THROUGH such a
    link, so the refusal has to come before it. That refusal works on every
    platform.

    Where the platform has them, the create+replace is anchored to a dir_fd
    opened O_NOFOLLOW: every later operation goes through that fd, so a swap
    after the check cannot reach the write. Windows has neither
    O_NOFOLLOW/O_DIRECTORY nor a handle-relative open (`os.supports_dir_fd` is
    empty — dir_fd is implemented with the POSIX `*at` calls), so its fallback
    re-resolves the path and the check-to-write window stays open there. It is
    NARROWED, not closed: the redirect check runs again after the payload is
    written and before it is published, so a swap still in place is refused and
    the temp file removed. Two windows stay open on that path (#494), both
    measured: a swap-and-restore around the create is undetectable from stdlib
    Python, and a swap landing after the second check leaves the path-based
    publish unable to find the temp file it wrote — it either raises or renames
    a file the attacker planted inside the attacker's own directory. Neither
    redirects the payload, and both end where a refusal ends: no event, so the
    run waits out session_timeout_min. That is the same outcome an attacker gets
    for free by leaving a redirect in place, which is refused without any race —
    winning the race buys no capability, which is why the residual is accepted
    rather than chased into ctypes/NtCreateFile inside a stdlib-only relay.

    Mode is 0o600 (narrowed from the umask-derived mode an ordinary `open()`
    produced): only the operator running the loop reads these.

    Raises OSError on any refusal or failure; the caller degrades to a no-op.
