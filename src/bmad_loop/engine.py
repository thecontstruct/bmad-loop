    ``exact`` says which set ``ids`` is. Armed BEFORE the write it is the INTENDED
    set (``exact=False``) — a raise inside the close itself must still be undoable,
    and reopening an id that never flipped is a safe no-op. Replaced after a normal
    return by the set actually marked (``exact=True``), which is the only form
    where an id that fails to reopen means something: its undo marker was there
    moments ago and is not now, so a foreign edit displaced it, and that is worth
    journaling rather than repairing around.

    Lives at module scope, not beside its method, because ``SweepEngine`` annotates
    the same parameter — a class body cannot host a module-level type.

        The enforcing half of ``gate:``. ``bmad-loop validate`` refuses the same
        story at preflight, but a preflight is only as strong as the operator's
        habit — ``run`` never called it, and ``_pick_next`` reads the board alone,
        so before this the field's whole promise rested on someone remembering to
        type a second command.

        **Placement is load-bearing.** Called from ``_loop`` before
        ``state.tasks[key] = task``, so the gated story is *not* recorded as
        touched by this run. That is what makes the refusal re-askable: a resume
        re-picks the same story and re-reads the ledger, so closing the entry and
        resuming runs it. Registering the task first — the obvious placement, next
        to ``_run_story`` — would put the key in ``_pick_next``'s ``base_skip``,
        and the gate would fire once and then silently retire the story for the
        rest of the run and every resume of it. A gate that drops the work it was
        protecting is worse than no gate.

        **Pause, not skip.** ``validate`` fails the whole preflight over one gated
        story, and the two surfaces have to agree or the operator learns to
        distrust both. It raises the reserved :data:`PAUSE_STORY_GATE` stage, which
        the TUI already renders and routes to its gate viewer.

        The ledger is re-read here rather than carried from preflight: a sweep (or
        a human) may have closed the entry since, and a gate answering from a stale
        snapshot would refuse work that has landed.

        **Unreadable ledger pauses too.** Degrading to "not gated" would let the
        one deferred check that is a refusal be disabled by a broken file, and the
        question "does this project use gates?" is answerable only from the file
        that will not open. ``deferred.ledger-unreadable`` is a ``validate``
        problem for the same reason.

        Two exemptions, both deliberate. ``SweepEngine`` overrides ``_loop`` and so
        never reaches this call — it must not, because the sweep is the only
        automated closer of the gating entry (``sweep.py`` `_close_resolved` /
        bundle close), and gating the sweep would deadlock the gate against its own
        remedy. And a resumed story *finishes* rather than stranding a half-done
        session with a live worktree; the gate applies to work that must not
        *start*, which is the same line ``validate`` draws when it passes a story
        the board has already finished.

        That second exemption belongs to ``_finish_inflight``'s finishing arms —
        the defer replay, the spec-approval continuation, the recorded-session
        replay, the commit completion — and not to its restart arm, which finishes
        nothing: it discards the worktree (or resets to baseline) and re-runs the
        story from scratch. So the restart arm re-asks this gate, and
        unconditionally. ``_pick_next`` cannot ask for it, having skipped the key as
        touched, and the run's own crash must not be what disables the one deferred
        check that refuses.

        Both call sites ask **before** their caller mutates anything, and that is
        one rule rather than two coincidences. In ``_loop`` it keeps the refusal
        re-askable; in the restart arm it keeps the ledger readable, because that
        arm's in-place rollback is ``git reset --hard <baseline>`` and a gate
        committed while the run was down is a commit *after* that baseline.

        Deliberately no "but did a session really run?" test there. Every available
        signal is wrong somewhere: ``attempt`` is bumped before the session launches,
        ``sessions`` is written only after one returns, and ``rearmed`` covers a
        stories-mode wedge (``StoriesEngine._pause_wedged``) that reaches ESCALATED
        with no session at all. The arm's own unwinding is the stronger guarantee.

        """Drop a half-built unit worktree and the four fields that LOCATE it.

        Scoped deliberately: `worktree_path`, `branch`, `baseline_commit` and
        `baseline_untracked` all name the mount or a measurement taken inside it, and
        each is wrong the moment it is gone.

        Spec ownership is released through `task.release_spec_paths_from_mount()`,
        which clears the attempt-owned pair and returns `spec_file` to the
        mount-relative spelling. It runs BEFORE `worktree_path` is cleared, because
        the relativization is measured against it.

        An earlier version left that pair alone, reasoning that
        `_bind_dispatched_spec_for_attempt` rebinds on the next attempt before any
        reader acts on it. The rebind does run — and returns None. The caller
        re-anchors both fields immediately above, so by the time the mount is deleted
        `spec_file` is an ABSOLUTE path into it; `_dispatched_spec_for_attempt`
        resolves that `strict=True`, raises, and leaves the fresh attempt unbound on
        a story whose spec is sitting in the replacement mount at the same relative
        place. Nothing downstream repairs it — `_record_dev_spec` no-ops while
        `spec_file` is set — so the repair prompt goes on naming the deleted path.
        The relative spelling is what `verify.resolve_spec_path` re-probes against
        the live workspace, which is how this bound correctly before the re-anchor
        existed.

        `baseline_ledger_digest` and the `pre_harvest_ledger` pair are measured in the
        mount too (`_ledger_digest` reads `workspace.paths.deferred_work`, which is
        rebased onto the unit under isolation) and are deliberately NOT cleared. The
        criterion is not "measured in the mount" but "read before anything re-measures
        it": `baseline_commit` has the `elif task.baseline_commit:` arm below, which
        fires on a later resume that finds `worktree_path` empty, while every path out
        of here forces `Phase.PENDING` and saves — so `_resumable_session` (which
        answers only for `*_RUNNING`/`*_VERIFY`) returns None and `_dev_phase` always
        re-enters with `resume_result is None`, re-stamping the digest at its own
        fresh-entry block. Clearing the ledger pair would be actively wrong: it is the
        crash-replay attribution `_disarm_ledger_snapshot` exists to preserve.

        `worktree_path`/`branch` name the mount; `baseline_commit`/`baseline_untracked`
        were MEASURED in it (`_dev_phase` stamps both from `self.workspace.root`, which
        is the unit under isolation). Clearing only the first pair leaves the second
        describing a tree that no longer exists, and the restart arm's own
        `elif task.baseline_commit:` hands them to `recovery_flow.rollback_or_pause`
        against the MAIN checkout on any later resume that finds `worktree_path` empty.

        That state is durable and reachable without a host death: the caller saves
        right after this, and `worktree_flow.run_isolated` assigns `task.worktree_path`
        only AFTER `open_unit_workspace` returns, so a `GitSpawnError` there pauses the
        run with the cleared value already persisted.

        Neither operand fails loud there. Linked worktrees share the main repo's object
        database, so force-deleting the unit branch does NOT make the baseline
        unresolvable -- a `git reset --hard` onto it succeeds from the main checkout.
        And a fresh worktree is a tracked-only checkout, so `baseline_untracked` is
        effectively empty; `verify._rollback_cleanup_plan` computes
        `untracked_files(repo) - set(baseline_untracked)` as its DELETION list, so every
        untracked file in the operator's own checkout reads as this attempt's debris.
        Under `scm.rollback_on_failure` that unlinks them; with the default off it
        pauses on a dirtiness no operator action can clear, which is the exact
        non-termination `rollback_or_pause`'s docstring promises against.

        `_dev_phase` re-stamps both from the replacement mount, so clearing costs the
        restart nothing -- it turns the `elif` into a correct no-op rather than a probe
        of the wrong tree. `None` (not `[]`) for the untracked half is the value
        `attempt_dirty` and `_rollback_cleanup_plan` both read as "nothing here is this
        attempt's to remove", and the same one `sweep`'s migration refusal already uses.

        Reached when `isolation` flipped `worktree -> none` across a resume: policy is
        re-read every resume and a change is journaled, never refused, so a task can
        arrive still recording the previous attempt's mount while execution happens in
        the MAIN workspace. `_finish_inflight` re-anchors `spec_file` INTO that mount
        first and unconditionally — the anchor must precede the `isolated` gate,
        because the relative spelling resolves against the main checkout, which carries
        the identical layout, and `recovery_flow` would restore over the operator's own
        copy. Every non-isolated leg that then proceeds has to UNDO that anchor, or it
        consumes a `spec_file` absolutized into a tree this run will not enter again:
        `_dispatched_spec_for_attempt` resolves it `strict=True`, raises, and leaves the
        attempt unbound, and an explicit-spec prompt meets the snapshot gate with
        nothing bound.

        FOUR call sites, not one. The restart arm carried this first, but the three
        continuation arms — the spec-approval `DEV_VERIFY` leg, the recorded-result
        `_resumable_session` leg and the `COMMITTING` finalizer — each finish their work
        and `return` without ever reaching it, so they were left consuming the anchored
        path. A helper rather than a hoist above the arm dispatch: the restart arm asks
        `_refuse_gated_story` FIRST and that can raise `RunPaused`, and the anchored
        spelling is load-bearing until an arm commits to acting. Releasing above the
        dispatch would undo it for a task that never proceeds.

        The BASELINE goes with the spec: `baseline_commit`/`baseline_untracked` were
        measured inside the mount, and handing them to `_rollback_or_pause` against the
        main checkout makes a unit's empty untracked snapshot read every untracked file
        in the operator's own checkout as this attempt's debris. The CLAIM goes too —
        `worktree_path` is how `runs` answers which tree owns the state this task has
        already persisted (`task_spec_root`, `task_stories_root`), so keeping it set
        anchors those readers on a tree the run has left. Clearing it is not deleting
        the tree: the directory stays where it is and the journal names it, and
        `workspace.open_unit_workspace` reclaims it if a later flip back to `worktree`
        needs its deterministic path.

        Does NOT fix `redrive_base_ref` / `spec_reaches_the_redrive`, and never could:
        those describe the re-drive rather than the attempt, and `bmad-loop resolve`
        asks them in a SEPARATE process before this resume runs. They take the live
        isolation mode as a parameter instead — see `runs.redrive_base_ref`.

        The review loop is skipped because there is nothing for it to converge
        ON. A review pass is bmad-build-auto re-invoked on the spec to second-guess
        the diff and finalize `done`; a park's outstanding work is not in the diff

        either re-park (no progress, budget burned) or "fix" the park away by
        finalizing `done`, which is the exact false-green the state exists to
        prevent. What the loop DOES contribute, the deterministic gate, is kept:
        this delegates to the same skip-review commit path, whose `_verify_review`
        now holds the park to its (awaiting-operator, awaiting-operator) pair, a
        non-empty action list, and the project's verify commands. Parked work
        clears every check that still applies to it — no commit path skips
        verification. Scope that claim to this gate: the dev gate's proof-of-work
        is the one check a park does NOT face, skipped there because a park may
        legitimately have produced no code at all (#676, `verify.verify_dev`).

        No `_defer` machinery: a park is a SUCCESS that commits, so there is no
        stash or rollback, and the ordinary path has no ledger snapshot to
        unwind. A crash-resumed DEV_VERIFY park can inherit an arm from before
        PROCEED's disarm; that exceptional snapshot is spent below. (A park that

        exist. Best-effort like `_restore_deferred_closes`, and for the same two
        reasons that arm imposes: in the `BaseException` arm an exception is
        genuinely travelling and this must not replace it, while in the
        `GitError` arm the error is already HANDLED and `_escalate` raises a
        fresh `RunPaused` — so the hazard there is preempting the escalation,
        which would strand the story in COMMITTING with no diagnosis on the
        record. Either way, this never raises.

        The put-back is atomic (#379). A torn restore leaves the record neither
        as the park wrote it nor as it was found, and `load` reads a truncated
        record as an entry owing nothing — a park silently discharged by a
        rollback of the commit it was written for.

        `OSError` stays the guard, and stays wide enough BECAUSE the put-back
        never resolves: the confined writer walks the components below the
        project root with `O_NOFOLLOW` and never calls `Path.resolve`, so the
        pre-3.13 `RuntimeError`-on-symlink-loop that forced
        `_restore_deferred_closes` (and `tui.launch`) to widen to `Exception`
        cannot arise on this path. That widening is a property of the resolve,
        not of the helper — do not copy it back here. `UnconfinedWriteError` is
        an `OSError` subclass precisely so a refusal arrives in this guard and
        gets journaled rather than escaping as a type nothing catches.

        Confined to `self.workspace.paths.project` — the WORKTREE root when one
        is mounted, matching `_write_park_record`, since that is the tree this
        record was written into — for the reason `operatoractions.record_park`
        is (#593): refusing a link at the record itself left the directories
        above it resolved by name, so a link planted at `.bmad-loop/` redirected
        the put-back out of the project entirely. `require_writable_target=True`
        (#597) keeps this writer's semantics identical to the other two writers
        of this same file; a read-only record is answered, not routed around.

        A failure is journaled rather than dropped, matching the model above:
        `validate` reports a board parked with no record but never a record left
        over for a park that is in no commit, so nothing else would ever surface
        this. The journal call is itself suppressed — a restore that must not

        Resolution is per skill tree because one run can mix them (dev=claude →

        is worth stating because it looks like a gap. ``read_frontmatter``
        degrades malformed YAML and non-UTF-8 to ``{}`` rather than raising, so
        ``status_of`` reads ``""`` and this returns True. That is correct rather
        than merely tolerated: an unparseable spec demonstrably does not say
        "parked", and ``verify_dev``'s own gate reads the very same ``{}``, so
        ``parked`` is False there too and the skip is unreachable on that leg no
        matter what this answers. Only OSError and an unresolvable binding are
        uncertainty about a spec that *does* say something.

        ``True`` when nothing is bound at all — the ordinary case, not a fallback.
        Note precisely what that tests: ``task.spec_file`` is an IN-RUN binding,
        set only after a session returns and its artifacts verify, so "unbound"
        means "this task object has no binding", NOT "no earlier park exists on
        disk". A story whose spec was parked by a previous RUN, or edited into the
        park status out of band, presents as unbound here and is eligible. The
        residual is recorded as a deferred finding on this change's spec rather
        than closed silently; closing it means keying eligibility on the spec the
        story resolves to rather than on the task's binding, which is a wider
        change than the one this gate makes.

        Called only from ``_dev_phase``'s ``resume_result is None`` block, beside
        the baseline capture — see the comment there for why the anchor is the
        PHASE and not the attempt. Reuses ``_dispatched_spec_for_attempt`` for the
        symlink/roots checks rather than re-deriving them: a second, laxer
        resolution here would be a second answer to "which file is this attempt's
        spec", and recovery already owns that question.

        Consequence worth knowing before touching either caller: that resolver is
        now invoked TWICE per dev phase — once here at phase entry, and once by
        the binder inside the attempt loop. They are two observations of the same
        path at different instants and neither may be folded into the other (this
        one must precede the first attempt; the binder's must be the one that
        promotes). Any test that counts calls to it has to say which observation
        it means — ``test_transient_initial_binding_fault_does_not_promote_after_bare_prompt``
        pins this one out for exactly that reason.

        For a story that is sprint-status: the decoupled ``bmad-build-auto`` skill

        it — and must do so
        before ``verify_dev`` checks the sprint stage. Mirrors ``verify_dev``:
        advance the story to the sprint stage matching the spec status the skill
        actually reached, so a failed or blocked session (spec not at the success
        status) never advances the sprint. No-op for the legacy path.

        This runs above the artifact gate because ``verify_dev`` reads the board it
        writes. That ordering does not generalize to bookkeeping a gate does not
        consume: ``SweepEngine`` makes this a no-op and closes bundle ledger entries
        from ``_post_dev_accepted_sync`` instead.

        Each advance also records ``board_advance_intended`` for
        ``_carry_board_advance`` (#350). The board written here is
        ``self.workspace.paths``', which under isolation is the unit worktree's copy
        — seeded and shielded for a gitignored board, so it never rides the merge —
        and the record is what lets the post-merge carry re-apply the same stage to
        the main checkout.

        The requested TARGET, never ``advance``'s return: that return is the status
        the board LANDED at, which a never-regress echo makes equal to the CURRENT
        status rather than to the intent. They can diverge only when the board was
        already at or past ``target``, and ``verify_dev`` reads that same board
        immediately after and rejects the attempt for the mismatch — so an attempt
        whose record and board disagree never reaches integration.

        Unconditional and latest-wins. Both writes sit inside the ``_generic_dev()``
        arm of the one method ``SweepEngine`` and ``StoriesEngine`` override to a

        Both halves are read live here, at the commit boundary: what the spec
        and the manifest say at the moment of the close is what the story
        declares — a declaration edited after the dev artifacts verified must
        not be closed against a stale snapshot, because the stale half of that
        can close an entry the final spec no longer names.

        Every degraded reading declares nothing, which is the safe direction
        for an advisory annotation: the entries stay ``open`` — a miss the next
        sweep or retro re-verifies — rather than closed on evidence nobody
        could read. An unreadable spec is journaled by
        ``_observed_frontmatter``; an unparseable one flattens to ``{}`` there
        like every other status gate; and a session-supplied path outside the
        orchestrator's roots is refused under the same containment rule the
        frontmatter-status reconcile applies, so a surprising absolute path can

        via ``closes_deferred:`` to ``status: done <date>`` + a ``resolution:``
        note (#234) — the regular-story counterpart of the sweep bundle close
        at ``SweepEngine._close_bundle_ledger_when_spec_status``.

        Declaration is the only signal: closure is never inferred from a diff.

        **Advisory by contract.** The annotation is traceability for the next
        sweep or retro, never a gate: no reading of the spec, the manifest or
        the ledger can fail the story, and every degraded reading leaves the
        entries ``open`` — the direction a sweep re-verifies and a retro can
        repair. That contract is the design: closure needs no transactional
        coupling to git, because the ledger's consumers re-verify entries
        against the codebase anyway.

        **Placement.** Runs from ``_finalize_commit_phase`` — after artifact
        verification, the verify commands, every checkpoint, the review loop,
        the ``pre_commit_gate`` workflows and the ``pre_commit`` veto — and
        still before ``finalize_commit``, whose ``git add -A`` stages an
        in-repo annotation into the story's own commit. Marking at dev-sync
        time instead let a story that later failed verification or review leave
        the ledger permanently claiming its work resolved.

        **In-repo is not stageable, and under isolation that is the difference
        between a delivered close and a lost one (#458).** This paragraph used
        to promise the opposite — "worktree isolation included: the unit's
        ledger rides the unit commit and reaches the target branch with the
        ordinary merge" — which holds only for a TRACKED ledger. A gitignored
        one (the default shape, since the ledger lives under the BMAD artifacts
        dir) is skipped by that ``git add -A`` in silence, brings nothing over
        with the merge, and dies with the worktree, while this method has
        already journaled ``story-deferred-closed``. ``story_closes_intended``
        + ``_carry_story_deferred_closes`` is the delivery path; ``_ledger_in_repo``
        below is a containment test and answers a different question.

        A ledger outside the repo (``ProjectPaths.rebased`` deliberately
        shares an external artifact dir between worktrees) is written at the
        same moment; the annotation is simply part of no commit, which is
        journaled (``deferred-close-external-ledger``). A merge that later
        fails leaves that annotation standing — visible, journaled and
        human-attended, the accepted advisory trade-off.

        ``snapshot``, when given, receives ``(ledger, pre-close text)`` the
        statement before the write, so the caller's failure arms can undo the
        edit no matter where inside the window a raise lands — including a
        journal append failing after the write published. Cleared again when
        nothing was flipped: an empty close needs no restore.

        Idempotent, so the COMMITTING resume arm may re-drive the commit phase

        permanent — a human-resolved re-drive sets ``resolved_redrive``, which has
        ``safe_reset`` preserve the artifact folders' tracked content through the
        rollback.

        **Entry-scoped, through the closes' own undo markers (#286).** This used to
        rewrite the whole document from the pre-close text and call the collateral
        an accepted advisory trade-off: within the commit window the engine was
        held to be the only writer worth knowing about, so whatever anyone else had
        added was restored away with the close. That contract is overturned. The
        window spans `finalize_commit`'s git spawns and, on the escalation leg, an
        operator-blocking pause, so a second orchestrator process, a sweep, the TUI
        decision modal or `sweep --archive` can and does write inside it — and a
        lock cannot be held across a window shaped like that (#286's own acceptance
        criterion). So the rollback reopens exactly the armed ids through the
        operation-specific markers ``mark_done_many_reopenable`` wrote, in ONE
        locked read-edit-write: a concurrent append, an unrelated close, a recorded
        human decision are each left standing, and a row this run never closed is
        never touched.

        An armed id that will not reopen is reported, never worked around. It only
        means anything for an ``exact`` arm — one narrowed to the ids actually
        marked — where the marker was on disk moments ago: something has since
        broken the ``resolution:``/``resolution-undo:`` adjacency the undo matches
        on (a foreign ``decision:`` line inserted after the status line does
        exactly this), so the entry stays ``done`` and the foreign content is
        preserved, with ``deferred-close-reopen-unmatched`` naming the ids. A
        pre-write arm carries the INTENDED set instead, where an id that never
        flipped is an ordinary silence rather than a signal, and nothing is
        reported.

        Advisory itself, twice over: a failed restore is journaled, never
        raised, and the journaling is suppressed rather than allowed to become
        the crash — this runs inside except arms whose exception must travel
        unchanged. Skipping the `raise` would replace a `RunStopped` with a
        symlink complaint; skipping the `GitError` arm's `_escalate` would
        strand the story in COMMITTING with no diagnosis on the record.

        The guard is type-agnostic on purpose, and `OSError` is not wide enough
        to hold it: the write under `mark_open_many` resolves the path before its
        own try, and below 3.13 `Path.resolve` reports a symlink loop as
        `RuntimeError` — the same non-OSError `_ledger_in_repo` already catches for
        this very path. Deriving the lock's own sidecar path can raise
        `runs.StateRootError`, which is likewise no `OSError`. Catching `Exception`
        and not `BaseException` is the other half: `RunStopped` is an `Exception`,
        so a second stop signal landing inside the restore is absorbed while the
        first still travels, and a genuine KeyboardInterrupt still gets out."""

        The ordinal is a public journal field and a ``post_dev_verify``

        a fresh process must not restart at 1 and mint a second record claiming
        an ordinal an earlier one already used. That property is the whole reason
        this used to re-derive the ordinal by rescanning the journal on every
        verification, which read and JSON-parsed the entire file each time — a
        file this same method keeps appending to, so the cost grew with the run
        that was paying it.

        The rescan survives here, once: the first allocation of an engine's life
        seeds the per-story map from the journal, and every later one is an
        in-memory increment. One scan, not one per verification, and the resume
        property is unchanged because a resumed run's seed reads the same journal
        the rescan did.

        Seeding EVERY story in one pass (rather than lazily per story) is sound
        because :meth:`_journal_verify_command_results` is the sole writer of
        this record kind and one Engine drives every unit of a run, so after the
        seed the map — not the file — is authoritative. A nested auto-sweep is

        Deliberately an ``Engine`` field and not a ``StoryTask`` one: the value
        is recoverable from the journal on every resume, so persisting it would
        add a ``state.json`` field that can only disagree with the record it
        duplicates. It is also NOT ``attempt`` — a human re-arm reuses attempt

        ``attempt`` and ``verification_stage`` make the public journal records
        correlate to a concrete dev, repair, or review verification pass — the
        third arrived with the review gates' sink (``_review_command_sink``) and
        is why ``verification_stage`` is not a two-value field.  The filenames
        contain only engine-derived ordinal values; command text never becomes a
        filesystem path.  Sanitize the whole composition, not the parts, for the
        reason :func:`_session_task_id` gives: two individually capped parts can
        still compose past a filename segment limit, and ``safe_segment``'s digest
        suffix differs between the two orders.

        Retention is bounded by ``verify.stream_capture_kb`` per stream, and the
        record says so rather than leaving the reader to guess: ``*_bytes`` is
        what the command emitted, ``*_captured_bytes`` how much of that reached
        disk, ``*_truncated`` their inequality.  Both counts are UTF-8 lengths of
        the decoded stream, NOT file sizes — see :func:`_bounded_stream_tail`.  A
        zero cap writes no file at all and leaves the pointer null; the record
        still lands, still carrying the full byte count, because "nothing was
        retained" and "the command was silent" are different facts.

        This is observation, so it degrades and never raises (AGENTS.md).  An
        ``OSError`` from the write — ENOSPC, a read-only run dir, ENAMETOOLONG on
        a path this composition did not shorten enough — is journalled as
        ``capture_error`` beside a null pointer and the verification continues.
        The alternative is a lost log killing a dev pass whose commands passed,
        which trades a diagnostic for the run it was there to diagnose.

        No results means no records, and therefore no sequence: the ordinal is
        allocated only when at least one record lands, so it never runs ahead of
        the journal it indexes. That is also the pre-existing behaviour — the
        max-of-journalled rescan this replaced could not observe an ordinal it
        had not written — and keeping it is what makes a resumed run number its
        passes identically to an uninterrupted one.

        writer's work with them (#286).

        The window being repaired spans ``_rollback_or_pause``'s git spawns, so a
        lock cannot cover it — :func:`deferredwork.ledger_lock` is contracted
        never to span a subprocess. Compare-and-set stands in, against two
        anchors, because this restore serves two different owners:

        * ``post_engine_ledger_digest`` — the bytes THIS engine last published.
          Matching it means the file on disk is the harvest append this restore
          exists to retract.
        * the ledger's committed blob at ``task.baseline_commit``, on a ledger
          git owns. That blob is exactly what ``reset --hard`` republished, it is
          nobody's concurrent write, and restoring the snapshot over it is what
          puts back the session's own ledger edits the reset erased. The anchor
          is read out of git rather than off the working tree because **a
          post-reset observation may justify a SKIP, never a WRITE**: a rival
          writing a tracked ledger inside the reset window would otherwise BE the
          observation this arm trusts, and the restore would overwrite it (#735).
          A probe that cannot answer withholds the anchor, so an unprovable
          baseline degrades to the same journaled skip rather than a write.

        Neither anchor holding means the text belongs to somebody else, and the
        restore degrades to a journaled skip rather than a write. **A retraction
        cannot be expressed as an append**, so there is no merge to fall back on
        the way :meth:`_restore_defer_ledger` has one. Skipping is safe by
        design: the harvest entries left standing are real findings rather than
        noise, ``append_entry``'s idempotence stops the next attempt filing them
        twice, and the attribution rebase at the call site reads a non-restored
        disk as "the ledger changed", which stands the harvest exclusion down and
        exposes MORE of the tree to the proof-of-work gate — the conservative
        direction (see :meth:`_harvest_gate_exclude`).

        The ``snapshot is None`` unlink is gated on the digest for the same
        reason, and that is a latent data loss being closed rather than a new
        guard: the code this replaces deleted whatever it found there, so a
        ledger a concurrent writer had created inside the window was removed
        along with the harvest that was supposed to be the only thing in it.

        Signature-stable on purpose — the direct-call unit tests drive this with
        an explicit snapshot. Write and lock faults propagate to the call site's
        net, which preserves an in-flight ``RunPaused`` rather than being
        replaced by a secondary repair failure.

        is a valid CommonMark H1, but recognizing it would make *any* prose line
        sitting above a ``===`` divider the commit subject. That trades this
        method's one safe failure mode — falling back to the story key — for a
        confidently wrong title, so the narrower contract is the right one and
        this docstring is the place it is stated.

        ``limits.max_tokens_per_story``, at the session boundary that crossed it.

        The cap is advisory by contract (docs/FEATURES.md) — this warns, it never
        terminates. Enforcement is the separate mid-session guard (#158,
        ``max_tokens_per_session``), a different cap with its own latch, untouched
        here.

        Placement is the whole point of #336. The predecessor check sat in
        ``_finalize_commit_phase`` past ``advance(task, Phase.DONE)``, so it saw
        only stories that committed and only after their last token was spent: the
        reported 4x overrun happened on a story that DEFERRED, which produced no
        record at all — total silence, not late silence. Every session of every run
        type funnels through ``_run_session``, so judging here covers the deferring
        and escalating stories too, and SweepEngine/StoriesEngine inherit it
        unchanged.

        Called after the tail ``_save()``, where ``task.tokens`` is both fresh
        (``attach_session_usage`` folded this session in above) and
        story-cumulative (it is the task's running total, not the session's). A
        session that aborted never reaches here — the exception propagates past the
        ``finally`` — so no story is judged on a usage read that did not happen.

        Weight comes from live ``self.policy``, not ``state.cache_read_weight()``:
        this is the enforcement side of the split documented at ``summary()`` —
        displays must reproduce from state.json, budgets bind at the policy the
        running process enforces.

        — injected into `_review_prompt` and `_generic_dev_prompt`, the two prompt
        seams `Engine` itself builds, the way the deferred-work sentence beside it
        is. It says nothing about what a session should do *instead*; that half is
        `_board_handback_redirect`, and it rides the review prompt only.

        Injection surface, exactly: story dev sessions (`_generic_dev_prompt`), the
        review sessions of sprint and sweep runs (both inherit `_review_prompt`),
        and every injected plugin-workflow session (`_run_session` wraps this in
        `WORKFLOW_BOARD_CONTRACT` post-gate — those run in the same window, at
        `post_dev_phase` / `post_review_result` / `pre_commit_gate`). `SweepEngine`
        and `StoriesEngine` override `_dev_prompt`, so no bundle or stories dev
        prompt reaches this; `StoriesEngine` overrides this method to "" as well,
        which drops it — the redirect gated on it, and the workflow section — from
        that mode's prompts too. Only the interactive resolve agent gets nothing
        from this seam, which costs nothing: `bmad-loop-resolve`'s own skill already
        forbids touching the board outright.

        The three injection points deliberately share ONE wording, so a reviewer, a
        dev session and a plugin workflow cannot be told three different things
        about who owns the board.

        They do NOT share unstrippability, and that asymmetry was weighed rather
        than overlooked. The workflow section is post-gate because it has to be —
        the prompt there is plugin text end to end, so there is no pre-gate string
        to inject into. The dev/review injections stay pre-gate: moving only this
        clause post-gate would assemble the review prompt in two files while the
        deferred-work sentence it was written to sit beside stayed strippable, and
        a plugin that rewrites `proposed_prompt` wholesale already discards the spec
        path, the ledger sentence and the #261 `expected_spec` pin with it — the
        codebase's existing reading is that such a rewrite means the plugin owns
        that session. If unstrippability is ever wanted here, move the whole
        orchestrator-authored appendix as one unit, not this sentence alone.

        `_post_dev_state_sync` advances sprint-status.yaml right after the dev
        session — to `done`, or to `awaiting-operator` on a park; those two values
        are exhaustive there — but the story's single commit lands only after the
        review loop, so every session dispatched in that window opens on an
        uncommitted, unattributed board change with nothing in the repo naming its
        author. A review session read the orchestrator's own write as a violation
        of its spec's Boundaries section, reverted it, and the #334 contradiction
        gate correctly escalated a story both sessions agreed was finished (#437).

        The row is called BOOKKEEPING and explicitly NOT proof of verification,
        because it is not: `_post_dev_state_sync` writes the board before
        `_verify_dev_artifacts` runs, and a repair session is dispatched precisely
        when that verification failed — it opens on a red tree under a `done` row.

        This reverses the "#334: review prompts are unchanged by design" rationale,
        which assumed forbidding the revert would let an unfinished story commit.
        #334's own code refutes it: `verify.verify_review` gates the SPEC
        frontmatter first and returns `retry` there, before it ever reads the
        board. A reviewer withholding sign-off through the spec already blocks the
        commit; the board revert was never the load-bearing channel.

        cannot raise it as an `intent_gap`."""

        is local and directly assertable (`StoriesEngine()._board_handback_redirect()
        == ""`), and `_review_prompt` stays structurally identical to the dev seam.

        `blocked` is named deliberately: it is the only spec status that both
        withholds the commit and reaches a human (`devcontract` synthesizes a
        CRITICAL from it and `decide_review_session` pauses). Any other non-terminal
        status merely retries until the cycle budget exhausts and `_defer` rolls the
        work back to baseline — honest dissent discarded in silence. "say why" is
        load-bearing: the `## Auto Run Result` detail becomes the escalation text a
        human reads.

        The trigger is deliberately NARROW — "cannot be finished without a human
        decision", not "looks unfinished". A review pass is itself a dev-primitive
        run whose job is to fix what it finds or defer it; a broad trigger would
        hand it a run-halting early exit on cycle 1 of 3.

        Review-only for the same reason it exists: that CRITICAL halts the whole
        run, which is the right trade for a review session and the wrong one for a
        dev session, where it would flatly contradict `_operator_park_instruction`'s
        "Never use the blocked status for this" a sentence later in the same prompt.

        The vocabulary overlap with the park clause ("a human decision" vs "actions
        only a HUMAN can perform outside the repo") was checked and is unreachable,
        not merely unlikely: the two never co-occur because each rides a different
        builder, and more strongly a parked story is never dispatched a review
        session at all — `_review_and_commit` early-returns on `_park_awaiting_operator`.
        The only residual is a story the dev pass should have parked and finalized
        `done` instead, and there this opens no new path (`blocked` is the skill's
        native escape) and displaces nothing better (park is dev-only, so a review
        session cannot park either way). Pause-and-reach-a-human beats a false-green

        The "never blocked" clause is the load-bearing half. `blocked` is the

        The review's own step-04 entry write (it stamps the transient `in-review`

        so the review's first result-less Stop reads that stale marker as this

        grace can never arm on the review leg (issue #160). Cycle 2+ carries the
        PREVIOUS review pass's own marker, so this runs before every review launch,
        never on the crash-resume replay branch (no session launches there). Unlike
        `_reset_spec_for_repair` the frontmatter is left untouched: `status: done` is
        what routes the re-invocation's step-01 to a fresh step-04 review pass — the
        HARD CONSTRAINT that the review-launch frontmatter status is NEVER mutated
        (it is load-bearing skill routing), so every #276 mechanism observes only.

        Returns a `SpecSnapshot` of the on-disk spec as it stood at launch — its
        content hash, mtime, and normalized frontmatter status — so the generic
        adapter's missing-marker fallback can refuse to synthesize from a candidate
        whose bytes never changed this session (a `done` spec re-opened for review,
        never re-written). "Normalized" means through `status_of`, the same reading
        the adapter's `_observe_tick` compares against: a blank/YAML-null `status:`
        must be `""` on BOTH sides or the tick fabricates a transition off it (see
        that method's docstring — the two reads are one contract).

        Snapshot capture is best-effort: a torn/unreadable read
        degrades to `None` (journaled, `review-launch-snapshot`), and the fallback
        then keeps its conservative 2-observation fingerprint path. Only the capture
        is guarded — the strip keeps its raise-on-unreadable repair doctrine (see
        `devcontract.strip_auto_run_result`): skipping the strip recreates the exact
        #160 bug state, so it must surface.

        attempt on `task.preserve_ref`, which fast-forwards straight back. Isolated,

        but an EARLIER attempt's in-worktree dev-retry rollback parks on the same

        lock cannot cover it — :func:`deferredwork.ledger_lock` is contracted
        never to span a subprocess. Compare-and-set stands in, anchored on the
        ledger's committed blob at ``task.baseline_commit`` — the text the reset
        republished — and anything else found under the lock belongs to somebody
        else.

        Three refusals, in order of how much they know:

        * ``observed == snapshot`` — the reset changed nothing, so there is
          nothing to put back. Today's quiet path, byte-identical.
        * the ledger is not git's — ``reset --hard`` cannot have touched an
          untracked or external file, so the whole delta arrived from a live
          foreign writer and the correct restore is no write at all. The guard
          this replaces compared ``current != snapshot`` and overwrote on exactly
          that difference: it ARMED the lost update it reads like it prevents.
        * the text under the lock is not the one the reset republished. The
          anchor is read out of git rather than off the working tree because **a
          post-reset observation may justify a SKIP, never a WRITE**: a rival
          writing a tracked ledger inside the reset window would otherwise BE the
          observation this arm trusts, and the overwrite would take that rival's
          entries with it (#735). Every other case — a writer who landed inside
          the window, or a baseline no probe could read — republishes the
          snapshot by APPENDING the entries disk has since lost, never by
          overwriting what arrived. Unlike :meth:`_restore_ledger`, this site can
          degrade all the way to that merge instead of to a skip: appending
          cannot destroy anybody's write.

        Write and lock faults propagate, as the unguarded write here always did:

        ``_record_review_budget_followup`` runs on a finalized, verify-green story
        the review pass would not stop recommending a follow-up for; under
        isolation that write is correct but is silently dropped when the main
        ledger is gitignored. Hence a carry rather than a guard, which would
        suppress a legitimate entry on every isolated run.

        No ``_isolated`` predicate: ``refiled_followups`` is populated by that one
        producer and this hook is reached only from the isolated DONE leg and its
        replay, so the record IS the guard.

        Unconditional and idempotent — ``append_entry`` dedupes an OPEN row with
        the same ``origin:`` + ``source_spec:``, while an already-CLOSED row with
        that provenance earns a fresh entry, exactly as a recurrence does in
        place. That is what lets the producer record its intent BEFORE its own
        append, which durability requires, so ``review-followup-carried`` with
        ``dw_ids == []`` is an ordinary outcome and not a carry that ran on
        nothing.

        A TRACKED ledger is safe unconditionally: no exclude or ignore rule masks a
        tracked file's MODIFICATION, so the unit's own write always rides the merge
        and its row arrives already deduped — yielding an empty ``carried`` and no
        commit.

        The commit is best effort — unlike ``_carry_harvested_deferrals``, whose
        re-raise is backed by ``harvest_carry_commit_pending`` — because it can
        only ever FAIL: the sole ledger shape that reaches it is a gitignored one,
        and ``git add`` refuses an ignored path with rc 1 every time, so a
        commit-pending latch would just retry a refusal. Nor can it leave the tree
        dirty, the shape it writes being the one git does not see. The row on disk
        is the value; the commit is bookkeeping.

        Every record must belong to the attempt now being committed — a premise
        ``_dev_phase`` enforces, not this frame. A record left over from an
        ABANDONED attempt died with its discarded worktree, so it has nothing
        upstream to dedupe against and the carry would append AND commit a row
        about work that never landed; the fresh-attempt clear beside
        ``harvested_deferrals`` is what prevents that (#457).

        The fourth and last producer in the ``git add -A`` family.
        ``_close_declared_deferred`` writes the ACTIVE workspace's ledger, so under
        isolation a gitignored one is flipped inside a unit worktree, skipped by
        ``finalize_commit``'s ``git add -A`` in silence, and deleted with the
        worktree — while the run has already journaled ``story-deferred-closed``.
        Left uncarried the entry stays ``open``, so ``deferredwork.open_ids``
        re-bundles resolved work on every later sweep: unbounded re-triage, not a
        one-time drop.

        ``mark_done_many_reopenable``, the same variant the commit-boundary close
        now uses, under the same ``_story_close_operation_id`` and the same
        ``_story_close_note``: byte-identity between a carried row and one the merge
        delivered is the point, and both halves of that comparison carry the
        ``resolution-undo:`` line since #286 made the story close entry-scoped. This
        paragraph used to say the opposite — no operation id, no undo marker — which
        was the byte-identity argument against the old close, and inverts with it.
        Only the date can differ, and only across a midnight boundary — the same
        accepted drift the park record carries.

        Unconditional and idempotent, with no tracked/ignored predicate. Idempotence
        here is stronger than the appends': ``_apply_done`` returns None for a row
        that is absent OR already ``done``, and ``_mark_done_many`` then writes
        nothing at all — not even a byte-identical rewrite. So a tracked ledger,
        whose close rode the merge, yields an empty ``carried`` and no commit, and a
        replay re-applying a landed carry is a no-op. ``story-deferred-close-carried``
        with ``dw_ids == []`` is an ordinary outcome.

        Best effort, like ``SweepEngine``'s close and unlike
        ``_carry_harvested_deferrals`` — and, as with
        ``_carry_review_budget_followups``, because the commit can only ever FAIL
        here rather than because failure is rare. Of the three shapes the main
        ledger can take, a tracked one is already closed by the merge; a
        gitignored one reaches ``commit_paths`` and ``git add`` refuses that
        ignored path with rc 1 every time, so a commit-pending latch would only
        retry a refusal. An untracked-but-not-ignored one used to be unreachable
        — ``clean_incoming_collisions`` refused the merge over it — and since
        #460 it reaches here too, where ``git add`` accepts it and the carry
        commits it, which is the leg that issue reported as never happening.

        ``self.paths``, not ``self.workspace.paths``, states the intent — the MAIN
        checkout's ledger. The two are the same path at every call site that
        reaches here: the workspace is swapped back before
        ``integrate_unit`` runs the hook, and before the resume replay does. So no
        test can tell the two apart, and none pretends to; the explicit form is
        kept because the intent stops being obvious the moment that stops holding.

        why it is a separate frame: a moment later this run's write is on the path and
        "was anybody else here" has stopped being answerable.

        ``dirty_paths`` — git's own answer — and nothing else decides whether EITHER
        comparison below runs at all. That ordering is load-bearing rather than an
        optimization: it is what keeps them from being asked about a board nobody has
        written, where the only honest answer is git's. It is NOT what makes the byte
        comparison safe on a repo that normalizes line endings — ``file_holds_content``
        hashes both sides through the path's clean filter for that, so no eol domain
        has to be guessed at either end.

        Fail CLOSED. A probe that could not run has not ruled an operator out, and the
        writes it gates are the ones that leave no trace of what they took. What the
        conservative answer costs depends on which check then answers, and neither cost
        is the destructive one: the sibling guarding the COMMIT costs a no-op commit,
        ``advance`` having already put the status on disk; the row check that PRECEDES
        ``advance`` costs the carry itself, and with it the next run re-picking the
        story — the #350 behavior, minus the false claim that it was fixed.

        A board outside the repo is the one False the failure paths do not share: git
        cannot commit it either way, so there is nothing here to protect and no
        baseline for either comparison below, and answering True would trade a no-op
        commit for a real refusal.

        A GITIGNORED board is the ceiling, and it is git's rather than this probe's.
        ``dirty_paths`` never reports one — ``git status --porcelain`` needs
        ``--ignored`` to spell it ``!!`` at all — so both comparisons are skipped
        here. Reporting it would change NOTHING, which is why the probe is left
        alone: an ignored board is untracked, HEAD carries no blob for it, and both
        comparisons accept a path HEAD does not carry precisely because there is no
        baseline to compare against (the #460 boundary). Measured. Nor can the COMMIT
        half of the hazard arise there — ``git add`` refuses an ignored path with rc 1
        every time. What is genuinely unprotected is the ADVANCE: a replayed carry can
        still overwrite a row an operator edited on an ignored board while the host

        ``advance`` would overwrite that this run did not put there, and it is handed
        back rather than a bare False because it is the whole of what the refusal has
        to report: nothing lands, so there is no ``landed`` to journal in its place.

        The one question the sibling below cannot be asked in time. That one guards the
        COMMIT and runs after ``advance``, which for the story's OWN row is after the
        evidence is gone — ``advance`` has replaced the operator's status with the
        target, so the board then holds precisely HEAD's bytes plus this advance and
        the proof rightly says so. Nor would refusing the commit at that point have
        saved anything: the status on disk is the value ``_pick_next`` schedules from.
        Hence a check that runs BEFORE the write.

        ADDITIVE, and about one ROW rather than the board. A stray on some OTHER row is
        not this write's to refuse — ``advance`` cannot reach it, and today's outcome
        there (the advance lands, the sibling declines the commit, ``_pick_next`` stays
        honest) is the right one. Refusing on a whole-board difference would trade that
        for a finished story re-picked by every run until a human intervenes.

        Two shapes are this pass's own. A row still holding HEAD's status was written by
        nobody since the commit ``advance`` recomputes from. A row already AT or PAST
        ``target`` is the replay leg's reason to exist — a crashed pass's landed advance
        — and never-regress means ``advance`` writes nothing over it either way, so that
        shape is settled first and without asking git anything, which keeps a replay off
        the fail-closed path entirely. An ABSENT row accepts too, and is not this
        frame's to judge: ``advance`` returns None over it and writes nothing, and
        ``board-advance-carry-failed`` already names that outcome.

        Fail CLOSED on git, like both siblings and for their reason. The board's own
        parse is deliberately NOT caught: for a board that carries no
        ``development_status`` map (or is not YAML at all) the live read here raises
        ``SprintStatusError`` exactly as ``advance`` would have raised it one call
        later, and quietly converting that into a refusal would dress a corrupt
        board as an operator's edit. A MISSING board is a different case and never
        reaches this frame: over one, ``advance`` returns None where this read's
        ``load`` raises — the two disagree, which is why the caller refuses the
        shape up front (``board-advance-carry-failed``) rather than letting the
        probe die on a file the writer would have shrugged at. A path HEAD does not
        carry accepts — the #460 boundary the sibling draws, drawn once for both.

        The discrimination the replay leg needs. Refusing on DIRT alone would break the
        recovery that leg exists for: a crashed pass's own advance IS uncommitted dirt
        on exactly this path, and finishing it is the point. So the question asked is
        not whether the board is dirty but whether what is on it is what this pass
        intends — recomputed from HEAD's blob through ``advance`` itself, then compared
        byte for byte. A crashed pass's write matches, ``advance`` being deterministic
        and never-regressing, so replaying a landed one lands on the same bytes; an
        operator's edit does not.

        HEAD's blob, not a snapshot taken earlier in the run: the baseline has to
        predate every writer, and only git holds one that does.

        A path HEAD does not carry answers True, leaving an untracked board committed
        exactly as before (#460). That is the boundary ``merge_local`` already draws —
        ``_carried_artifact_rels`` filters ``protected`` to TRACKED paths, because
        protecting an untracked artifact would halt every run whose project never
        committed its board — and a second frame drawing it elsewhere would make the
        pair unreadable.

        BOTH of the places git holds this path are proved, because `commit_paths`
        overwrites both: the working tree it copies into the commit, and the index it
        stages over. A staged edit distinct from HEAD and from this advance survives
        neither, so proving the working tree alone would authorize destroying it.

        Sameness is GIT's question here, not a byte compare's (``file_holds_content``).
        The baseline is HEAD's raw blob, and the board on disk may be its CRLF twin or
        its LF one depending on nothing the run controls — git calls the tree clean
        either way, so a byte compare would have to guess, and either guess refuses a
        pristine board on the hosts the other guess serves. Both sides hashed through
        the path's clean filter answers the only question worth asking, and still parts
        an operator's added row from this pass's advance.

        Fail CLOSED, like its sibling and for its reason, and that covers
        ``advanced_bytes`` returning None: a row missing from HEAD's board leaves nothing
        to compare against, and "I could not compute the intended content" must not read
        as "the tree is mine". A row the writer declines to rewrite is NOT that case — it

        The one member of the ``git add -A`` family that is not about the
        deferred-work ledger. ``_post_dev_state_sync`` advances
        ``self.workspace.paths.sprint_status``, which under isolation is the unit
        worktree's board: for a GITIGNORED board that is ``_board_seed``'s copy,
        shielded from ``finalize_commit``'s ``git add -A`` with every other seeded
        rel, so the advance never rides the unit branch and dies with the worktree
        at teardown. Uncarried, the main board keeps the story at
        ``ready-for-dev`` — inside ``ACTIONABLE_STATUSES`` — and ``_pick_next``,
        which reads the MAIN board, re-picks finished work on the next run.

        Through ``sprintstatus.advance``, the orchestrator's sole write path to this
        file, never a copy of the worktree's: that keeps the never-regress rule and
        the comment-preserving line edit in one place, and a copy would also
        overwrite rows the worktree's board knows nothing about.

        ``self.paths``, not ``self.workspace.paths`` — the MAIN checkout's board, for
        the reason spelled out in ``_carry_story_deferred_closes``: the workspace is
        swapped back before every call site reaches here, so no test can tell them
        apart, and the explicit form states an intent that stops being obvious the
        moment that stops holding.

        Unconditional and idempotent, with no tracked/ignored predicate. ``advance``
        never regresses, so re-applying a landed carry is a no-op, and so is the
        whole call for a TRACKED board: the worktree's flip is an ordinary
        modification that no ignore rule masks, so it rides the merge and the main
        board is already at the target when this runs. ``board-advance-carried``
        naming a status the carry did not itself write is an ordinary outcome.

        No ``now=``: refreshing ``last_updated`` is ``bmad-loop confirm``'s to do,
        and passing it here would rewrite a second line — a whole-file relay on a
        usually-tracked file (#576) — for bookkeeping the story's own advance
        already declined to touch.

        Best effort, like the two carries above it, and for their reason: of the
        board shapes that reach this frame, a gitignored one is the only one with
        anything to write, and ``git add`` refuses an ignored path with rc 1 every
        time — a commit-pending latch would only retry a refusal. The status on disk
        is the value that keeps ``_pick_next`` honest; the commit is bookkeeping.
        The commit is not gated on evidence of a WRITE, because ``advance`` cannot
        report whether it wrote (a never-regress echo returns the target too) — and it
        does not need to be: an unchanged board simply gives ``commit_paths`` nothing
        to commit.

        What the commit must NOT be given is somebody else's bytes, and on the LIVE
        merge path ``clean_incoming_collisions`` has already accounted for those:
        inside the branch's incoming set unrelated dirt was restored, and outside that
        set it REFUSED the merge, this frame among everything else it precedes (the
        board is one of the two paths ``merge_local`` passes as ``protected``,
        precisely because the pathspec stage below would otherwise commit it). That
        pre-flight does not precede every caller. ``_replay_unlatched_ledger_carries``
        falls straight through to the carry for a unit whose ``unit-merged`` was
        already journaled — it re-runs no merge on that leg, so no pre-flight runs on
        it either — and an edit the operator made while the host was down would ride
        out under this method's own message, tree clean behind it. Hence
        ``_board_carry_must_prove_ownership``, which asks there what the pre-flight
        asks here.

        Ownership is then asked TWICE, on either side of ``advance``, because the two
        questions have different deadlines. What the COMMIT must not be handed is
        answerable afterwards, about the whole board. What ``advance`` ITSELF must not
        overwrite is answerable only before it, and only about this story's row — so
        ``_board_carry_foreign_row_status`` leads, and a refusal there returns without
        journaling ``board-advance-carried``: nothing reached the disk, and that event's
        claim is precisely that the status did.

        What ``advance`` CAN report is that the row did not REACH ``target``, and
        that is a different question from whether it wrote — the one this method has
        to ask before naming its outcome ``board-advance-carried``. It answers
        below-target in two shapes, both of them a carry that did not happen: `None`
        when the story's row is gone (deleted or renamed while the isolated session
        held its own copy, or before a merge-to-carry replay), and
        the current status when the row is there but ``_set_mapping_value``'s line
        regex could not rewrite it — a quoted or block-scalar key, which
        ``story_status``'s full YAML parse resolves and the writer then declines.
        A whole board that is gone is the shape ``advance`` cannot be allowed to
        answer for at all: it returns None over a missing file, but the pre-advance
        row probe's own read raises ``SprintStatusError`` there — so the caller
        refuses it before either runs, on the same journal row. Latching any of
        these as carried would file a success for a main board still
        sitting in ``ACTIONABLE_STATUSES``, and the run would tear the worktree
        holding the advanced copy down on the strength of that record. It journals
        ``board-advance-carry-failed`` instead and skips the commit, which has
        nothing to carry. Still best effort, not a raise: the shapes that get here
        are ones a retry cannot repair (a board that is gone stays gone), and the
        cost of the honest record is the next run re-picking the story — the #350
        behavior, minus the false claim that it was fixed.

        A story that defers twice re-stashes the same filename, so the target may
        exist. `shutil.move` survived that on Windows only by accident: `os.rename`
        raises FileExistsError over an existing target, `move` catches *any* OSError
        and falls back to `copy2` + `unlink`. Two real hazards ride on that fallback
        (#101) — it re-fails outright when an AV/indexer handle turns the rename into
        a sharing violation (WinError 5/32) and `copy2` then cannot open the same
        locked target, and it is non-atomic, so a crash mid-copy leaves a truncated
        stash. Staging a copy inside `dest` and `atomic_replace`-ing it onto the
        target overwrites in one step, carries #98's win32 retry, and — because the
        staging copy lives in `dest` — keeps the replace same-filesystem, preserving
        `shutil.move`'s cross-device tolerance.

        Both halves of the move are retried: Windows denies a delete against an open
        handle just as it denies a rename-over, so an unretried `unlink` would fail
        the run on the very hazard the replace now rides out. The order is
        replace-then-unlink because `_defer` calls this before the rollback and the
        `story-deferred` journal append — a failure here aborts the deferral, so it

        string breaks ``bmad-loop diagnose`` outright rather than being redacted.

        """Run a child deferred-work sweep when policy [sweep].auto matches.
        The child is its own resumable run; a paused or failed child is
        journaled + notified but never interrupts this run — "failed" including a
        ``SystemExit`` (#600). A stop or a ``KeyboardInterrupt`` delivered through
        the child is the deliberate exception and propagates to the owner (#601);
        the arms below carry why, in both directions.

        ``state.sweeps_triggered`` spends the trigger only once a child sweep has
        actually started. The ``started`` thunk handed to the factory
        (:class:`SweepFactory`) fires at ``compose_sweep``'s success boundary, and
        a plain return latches too — so the thunk's only job is to classify a
        *raise*, and a raise that never reached that boundary leaves the trigger
        unspent.

        What that is worth, stated precisely, because the intuitive answer is
        wrong. It is NOT "the trigger gets retried later": at both call sites the
        retry closes within a few statements of an un-latched return.

        - ``run-end`` fires from :meth:`_loop`, whose return lands directly on
          ``self.state.finished = True`` in :meth:`_run_inner`; a finished run is
          refused outright by ``cli._resume_paused_run``. There is no later ask.
        - ``per-epic`` fires from :meth:`_epic_boundary`, and that boundary is
          detected as ``state.current_epic != story.epic`` — a field that advances
          within the same frame, either before the gate's ``RunPaused`` or on
          return into ``_loop``. Nothing in between can pause the run: ``gates``
          notification never raises (it swallows its own ``OSError``), and
          :meth:`_emit` isolates both hook kinds (``_HookError`` for a declarative
          hook, ``except Exception`` for an in-process one) and *returns* vetoes
          rather than raising them — which this caller does not even resolve.

        So the retry survives only in a crash window: a process death, or a
        ``BaseException``, between the un-latched return and the state write that
        closes the boundary. Do not widen that claim in a comment or a changelog.
        What the ordering buys on every non-crashing run is that
        ``sweeps_triggered`` is *true* — it is durable run state, rendered by
        ``bmad-loop diagnose`` (``diagnostics.py``), and a record's whole value is
        that it does not claim work that never happened.

        The worktree check therefore sits AHEAD of the latch rather than behind
        it. ``verify.worktree_clean`` fails closed on a ``GitError`` and
        ``_run_git`` maps a ``subprocess.TimeoutExpired`` onto exactly that, so a
        `git status` that merely timed out used to spend the run's one and only
        sweep trigger, permanently and silently. Both refusals carry a ``reason``
        so the journal separates a genuinely dirty tree from a git fault.

        That contract is stated over "a paused or failed child" while the guard
        below was written over ``Exception``, and the two sets differ in BOTH
        directions — which is why the arms are shaped the way they are:

        - ``SystemExit`` is a failed child the guard did not cover. It is a
          ``BaseException``, so it was missed here, by every arm of
          :meth:`_run_inner`, and by ``cli.main`` — it unwound through the
          ``finally`` (persisting this trigger's already-burned latch) and
          killed the process at exit 1, leaving the parent neither ``finished``
          nor ``crashed``, with no ``run-complete`` and an orphaned session.
          ``runsetup.make_adapters`` raises it, reachably: the unusable-mux
          refusal sits behind ``mux_usable``, a live uncached ``shutil.which``
          re-run on every call.
        - ``RunStopped`` is the reverse — an ``Exception`` that is not a failure
          at all. The child's hard-stop arm re-raises it precisely so the owner
          records the stop; swallowing it as ``sweep-auto-failed`` let the
          parent run on to ``finished`` AND left it unstoppable, since the
          signal handler latches ``_stopping`` before raising and every later
          SIGTERM then returns early.

        Deliberately NOT ``BaseException``: ``KeyboardInterrupt`` must keep
        escaping, because the nested-child re-raise in :meth:`_run_inner`
        depends on it reaching the owner."""
