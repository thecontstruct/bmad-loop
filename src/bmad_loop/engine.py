        far enough to touch it — rare once the adapter's missing-marker fallback
        (#224) completes those sessions, but a review that never wrote the spec
        at all still lands here) or ``in-review`` (the mid-review interrupt: the
        dying pass flipped the transient marker and died — reset it forward,
        stripping any partial terminal section so the next launch's mtime-floor
        scan can't misread it). Anything else — ``blocked``, ``in-progress``, a
        custom token — was set deliberately or means unfinished dev work: never
        salvage over it. The commit is gated on the same authoritative
        ``_verify_review`` as every other converge path, so salvage can never
        ship unverified work; a timeout that produced no review result neither
        re-arms ``followup_review_recommended`` nor spends a damping grant — the

        actually on disk rather than hardcoded: a target project can be on
        either era. This is NOT ``policy.dev.skill`` — that stays the adapter
        discriminator ``_generic_dev`` reads; only the spelled name moves.

        Resolution is per skill tree because one run can mix them (dev=claude →

        Resolved against the WORKSPACE, never the main checkout: the session runs
        with ``cwd=self.workspace.root``, so the tree deciding whether the spelled
        name is a command at all is the worktree's. The two agree on a freshly
        provisioned unit — ``provision_worktree`` copies the primitive in from the

        worktree without re-provisioning it, so a main checkout upgraded across the
        pause would resolve the new name into a worktree carrying only the legacy
        one, and the session HALTs on an unknown command having written nothing.

        ``Status:`` disagrees with the frontmatter the synthesis trusted — that

        follow-up policy, so without this bridge the recorded findings are
        invisible to every sweep reader downstream.

        This is era-agnostic: the gates are the generic-dev seam and the field's
        presence, never the skill name resolved on disk. A pre-#2640 spec simply
        takes the no-op path. The spec must also be at the current dev success
        status, matching the append-on-success behavior of the former writer.

        Replays are idempotent even after an entry is closed. ``append_entry``
        intentionally dedupes open entries only, so the pre-scan checks the
        fingerprinted ``origin:`` plus ``source_spec:`` across entries of every
        status. The spec frontmatter is never mutated; the ledger watermark is
        sufficient and avoids unsafe YAML block-scalar surgery.

        Declaration is the only signal: closure is never inferred from a diff.

        **Advisory by contract.** The annotation is traceability for the next

        repair. That contract is the design: closure needs no transactional
        coupling to git, because the ledger's consumers re-verify entries
        against the codebase anyway.

        **Placement.** Runs from ``_finalize_commit_phase`` — after artifact
        verification, the verify commands, every checkpoint, the review loop,
        the ``pre_commit_gate`` workflows and the ``pre_commit`` veto — and
        still before ``finalize_commit``, whose ``git add -A`` stages an
        in-repo annotation into the story's own commit. Marking at dev-sync
        time instead let a story that later failed verification or review leave
        the ledger permanently claiming its work resolved.

        ledger rides the unit commit and reaches the target branch with the
        ordinary merge" — which holds only for a TRACKED ledger. A gitignored
        one (the default shape, since the ledger lives under the BMAD artifacts
        dir) is skipped by that ``git add -A`` in silence, brings nothing over
        with the merge, and dies with the worktree, while this method has
        already journaled ``story-deferred-closed``. ``story_closes_intended``
        + ``_carry_story_deferred_closes`` is the delivery path; ``_ledger_in_repo``
        below is a containment test and answers a different question.

        A ledger outside the repo (``ProjectPaths.rebased`` deliberately
        shares an external artifact dir between worktrees) is written at the
        same moment; the annotation is simply part of no commit, which is
        journaled (``deferred-close-external-ledger``). A merge that later
        fails leaves that annotation standing — visible, journaled and
        human-attended, the accepted advisory trade-off.

        ``snapshot``, when given, receives ``(ledger, pre-close text)`` the
        statement before the write, so the caller's failure arms can undo the
        edit no matter where inside the window a raise lands — including a
        journal append failing after the write published. Cleared again when
        nothing was flipped: an empty close needs no restore.

        Idempotent, so the COMMITTING resume arm may re-drive the commit phase
        freely — ids are classified against the ledger text, and an entry
        already ``done`` is a satisfied declaration, not an unmatched one."""
        ids = self._declared_deferred_ids(task)

        # re-drive that reaches the carry has always re-entered here first, and this

        The cap is advisory by contract (docs/FEATURES.md) — this warns, it never
        terminates. Enforcement is the separate mid-session guard (#158,
        ``max_tokens_per_session``), a different cap with its own latch, untouched
        here.

        Placement is the whole point of #336. The predecessor check sat in
        ``_finalize_commit_phase`` past ``advance(task, Phase.DONE)``, so it saw
        only stories that committed and only after their last token was spent: the
        reported 4x overrun happened on a story that DEFERRED, which produced no
        record at all — total silence, not late silence. Every session of every run
        type funnels through ``_run_session``, so judging here covers the deferring
        and escalating stories too, and SweepEngine/StoriesEngine inherit it
        unchanged.

        Called after the tail ``_save()``, where ``task.tokens`` is both fresh
        (``attach_session_usage`` folded this session in above) and
        story-cumulative (it is the task's running total, not the session's). A
        session that aborted never reaches here — the exception propagates past the
        ``finally`` — so no story is judged on a usage read that did not happen.

        Weight comes from live ``self.policy``, not ``state.cache_read_weight()``:
        this is the enforcement side of the split documented at ``summary()`` —
        displays must reproduce from state.json, budgets bind at the policy the
        running process enforces.

        """The board-ownership PROHIBITION — never write the board, never revert it
        — injected into `_review_prompt` and `_generic_dev_prompt`, the two prompt
        seams `Engine` itself builds, the way the deferred-work sentence beside it
        is. It says nothing about what a session should do *instead*; that half is
        `_board_handback_redirect`, and it rides the review prompt only.

        Injection surface, exactly: story dev sessions (`_generic_dev_prompt`), the
        review sessions of sprint and sweep runs (both inherit `_review_prompt`),
        and every injected plugin-workflow session (`_run_session` wraps this in
        `WORKFLOW_BOARD_CONTRACT` post-gate — those run in the same window, at
        `post_dev_phase` / `post_review_result` / `pre_commit_gate`). `SweepEngine`
        and `StoriesEngine` override `_dev_prompt`, so no bundle or stories dev
        prompt reaches this; `StoriesEngine` overrides this method to "" as well,
        which drops it — the redirect gated on it, and the workflow section — from
        that mode's prompts too. Only the interactive resolve agent gets nothing
        from this seam, which costs nothing: `bmad-loop-resolve`'s own skill already
        forbids touching the board outright.

        The three injection points deliberately share ONE wording, so a reviewer, a
        dev session and a plugin workflow cannot be told three different things
        about who owns the board.

        They do NOT share unstrippability, and that asymmetry was weighed rather
        than overlooked. The workflow section is post-gate because it has to be —
        the prompt there is plugin text end to end, so there is no pre-gate string
        to inject into. The dev/review injections stay pre-gate: moving only this
        clause post-gate would assemble the review prompt in two files while the
        deferred-work sentence it was written to sit beside stayed strippable, and
        a plugin that rewrites `proposed_prompt` wholesale already discards the spec
        path, the ledger sentence and the #261 `expected_spec` pin with it — the
        codebase's existing reading is that such a rewrite means the plugin owns
        that session. If unstrippability is ever wanted here, move the whole
        orchestrator-authored appendix as one unit, not this sentence alone.

        `_post_dev_state_sync` advances sprint-status.yaml right after the dev
        session — to `done`, or to `awaiting-operator` on a park; those two values
        are exhaustive there — but the story's single commit lands only after the
        review loop, so every session dispatched in that window opens on an
        uncommitted, unattributed board change with nothing in the repo naming its
        author. A review session read the orchestrator's own write as a violation
        of its spec's Boundaries section, reverted it, and the #334 contradiction
        gate correctly escalated a story both sessions agreed was finished (#437).

        The row is called BOOKKEEPING and explicitly NOT proof of verification,
        because it is not: `_post_dev_state_sync` writes the board before
        `_verify_dev_artifacts` runs, and a repair session is dispatched precisely
        when that verification failed — it opens on a red tree under a `done` row.

        This reverses the "#334: review prompts are unchanged by design" rationale,
        which assumed forbidding the revert would let an unfinished story commit.
        #334's own code refutes it: `verify.verify_review` gates the SPEC
        frontmatter first and returns `retry` there, before it ever reads the
        board. A reviewer withholding sign-off through the spec already blocks the
        commit; the board revert was never the load-bearing channel.

        Returned as a bare sentence with NO leading separator, because the call
        sites need different ones. Deliberately backtick-free, for the reason
        `_operator_park_instruction` documents, and injected BEFORE that clause so
        the park contract stays the last thing a dev prompt says. Phrased as a
        prohibition rather than a goal so the skill's intent-alignment auditor
        cannot raise it as an `intent_gap`."""

        is local and directly assertable (`StoriesEngine()._board_handback_redirect()
        == ""`), and `_review_prompt` stays structurally identical to the dev seam.

        `blocked` is named deliberately: it is the only spec status that both
        withholds the commit and reaches a human (`devcontract` synthesizes a
        CRITICAL from it and `decide_review_session` pauses). Any other non-terminal
        status merely retries until the cycle budget exhausts and `_defer` rolls the
        work back to baseline — honest dissent discarded in silence. "say why" is
        load-bearing: the `## Auto Run Result` detail becomes the escalation text a
        human reads.

        The trigger is deliberately NARROW — "cannot be finished without a human
        decision", not "looks unfinished". A review pass is itself a dev-primitive
        run whose job is to fix what it finds or defer it; a broad trigger would
        hand it a run-halting early exit on cycle 1 of 3.

        Review-only for the same reason it exists: that CRITICAL halts the whole
        run, which is the right trade for a review session and the wrong one for a
        dev session, where it would flatly contradict `_operator_park_instruction`'s
        "Never use the blocked status for this" a sentence later in the same prompt.

        The vocabulary overlap with the park clause ("a human decision" vs "actions
        only a HUMAN can perform outside the repo") was checked and is unreachable,
        not merely unlikely: the two never co-occur because each rides a different
        builder, and more strongly a parked story is never dispatched a review
        session at all — `_review_and_commit` early-returns on `_park_awaiting_operator`.
        The only residual is a story the dev pass should have parked and finalized
        `done` instead, and there this opens no new path (`blocked` is the skill's
        native escape) and displaces nothing better (park is dev-only, so a review
        session cannot park either way). Pause-and-reach-a-human beats a false-green

        A follow-up review session re-invokes bmad-dev-auto on the FINALIZED spec,
        which still carries the dev pass's terminal `## Auto Run Result` section.
        The review's own step-04 entry write (it stamps the transient `in-review`
        status) bumps the spec's mtime past `find_result_artifact`'s launch floor,
        so the review's first result-less Stop reads that stale marker as this
        session's terminal result and kills the session mid-flight — the #109 stall
        grace can never arm on the review leg (issue #160). Cycle 2+ carries the
        PREVIOUS review pass's own marker, so this runs before every review launch,
        never on the crash-resume replay branch (no session launches there). Unlike
        `_reset_spec_for_repair` the frontmatter is left untouched: `status: done` is
        what routes the re-invocation's step-01 to a fresh step-04 review pass — the
        HARD CONSTRAINT that the review-launch frontmatter status is NEVER mutated
        (it is load-bearing skill routing), so every #276 mechanism observes only.

        Returns a `SpecSnapshot` of the on-disk spec as it stood at launch — its
        content hash, mtime, and normalized frontmatter status — so the generic
        adapter's missing-marker fallback can refuse to synthesize from a candidate
        whose bytes never changed this session (a `done` spec re-opened for review,
        never re-written). "Normalized" means through `status_of`, the same reading
        the adapter's `_observe_tick` compares against: a blank/YAML-null `status:`
        must be `""` on BOTH sides or the tick fabricates a transition off it (see
        that method's docstring — the two reads are one contract).

        Snapshot capture is best-effort: a torn/unreadable read
        degrades to `None` (journaled, `review-launch-snapshot`), and the fallback
        then keeps its conservative 2-observation fingerprint path. Only the capture
        is guarded — the strip keeps its raise-on-unreadable repair doctrine (see
        `devcontract.strip_auto_run_result`): skipping the strip recreates the exact
        #160 bug state, so it must surface.

        attempt on `task.preserve_ref`, which fast-forwards straight back. Isolated,
        *this* defer rolls nothing back — a kept-failed unit's branch stays mounted —
        but an EARLIER attempt's in-worktree dev-retry rollback parks on the same

        is not fast-forwardable from either tree (the unit branch has since moved on
        with the deferred attempt's commits, and fast-forwarding it into the
        operator's checkout would land a *discarded* attempt on their branch).

        The third producer in the ``git add -A`` family (#425).
        ``_record_review_budget_followup`` runs on a finalized, verify-green story
        the review pass would not stop recommending a follow-up for; under
        isolation that write is correct but is silently dropped when the main
        ledger is gitignored. Hence a carry rather than a guard, which would
        suppress a legitimate entry on every isolated run.

        No ``_isolated`` predicate: ``refiled_followups`` is populated by that one
        producer and this hook is reached only from the isolated DONE leg and its
        replay, so the record IS the guard.

        Unconditional and idempotent — ``append_entry`` dedupes an OPEN row with
        the same ``origin:`` + ``source_spec:``, while an already-CLOSED row with
        that provenance earns a fresh entry, exactly as a recurrence does in
        place. That is what lets the producer record its intent BEFORE its own
        append, which durability requires, so ``review-followup-carried`` with
        ``dw_ids == []`` is an ordinary outcome and not a carry that ran on
        nothing.

        A TRACKED ledger is safe unconditionally: no exclude or ignore rule masks a
        tracked file's MODIFICATION, so the unit's own write always rides the merge
        and its row arrives already deduped — yielding an empty ``carried`` and no
        commit.

        The commit is best effort — unlike ``_carry_harvested_deferrals``, whose
        re-raise is backed by ``harvest_carry_commit_pending`` — because it can
        only ever FAIL: the sole ledger shape that reaches it is a gitignored one,
        and ``git add`` refuses an ignored path with rc 1 every time, so a
        commit-pending latch would just retry a refusal. Nor can it leave the tree
        dirty, the shape it writes being the one git does not see. The row on disk
        is the value; the commit is bookkeeping.

        Every record must belong to the attempt now being committed — a premise
        ``_dev_phase`` enforces, not this frame. A record left over from an
        ABANDONED attempt died with its discarded worktree, so it has nothing
        upstream to dedupe against and the carry would append AND commit a row
        about work that never landed; the fresh-attempt clear beside
        ``harvested_deferrals`` is what prevents that (#457).

        The fourth and last producer in the ``git add -A`` family.
        ``_close_declared_deferred`` writes the ACTIVE workspace's ledger, so under
        isolation a gitignored one is flipped inside a unit worktree, skipped by
        ``finalize_commit``'s ``git add -A`` in silence, and deleted with the
        worktree — while the run has already journaled ``story-deferred-closed``.
        Left uncarried the entry stays ``open``, so ``deferredwork.open_ids``
        re-bundles resolved work on every later sweep: unbounded re-triage, not a
        one-time drop.

        ``mark_done_many``, NOT the reopenable variant ``SweepEngine`` uses: a story
        close carries no operation id and no ``resolution-undo:`` line, so this is
        what keeps a carried row byte-identical to one the merge delivered. The note
        goes through ``_story_close_note`` for the same reason. Only the date can
        differ, and only across a midnight boundary — the same accepted drift the
        park record carries.

        Unconditional and idempotent, with no tracked/ignored predicate. Idempotence
        here is stronger than the appends': ``_apply_done`` returns None for a row
        that is absent OR already ``done``, and ``_mark_done_many`` then writes
        nothing at all — not even a byte-identical rewrite. So a tracked ledger,
        whose close rode the merge, yields an empty ``carried`` and no commit, and a
        replay re-applying a landed carry is a no-op. ``story-deferred-close-carried``
        with ``dw_ids == []`` is an ordinary outcome.

        Best effort, like ``SweepEngine``'s close and unlike
        ``_carry_harvested_deferrals`` — and, as with
        ``_carry_review_budget_followups``, because the commit can only ever FAIL
        here rather than because failure is rare. Of the three shapes the main
        ledger can take, only a gitignored one reaches ``commit_paths`` at all: a
        tracked one is already closed by the merge, and an untracked-but-not-ignored
        one never reaches this frame because ``clean_incoming_collisions`` refuses
        the merge first. ``git add`` then refuses that ignored path with rc 1 every
        time, so a commit-pending latch would only retry a refusal.

        ``self.paths``, not ``self.workspace.paths``, states the intent — the MAIN
        checkout's ledger. The two are the same path at every call site that
        reaches here: the workspace is swapped back before
        ``integrate_unit`` runs the hook, and before the resume replay does. So no
        test can tell the two apart, and none pretends to; the explicit form is
        kept because the intent stops being obvious the moment that stops holding.

        dir: a leftover in-review spec would confuse the next attempt, but the
        work in it is worth keeping for the human.

        A story that defers twice re-stashes the same filename, so the target may
        exist. `shutil.move` survived that on Windows only by accident: `os.rename`
        raises FileExistsError over an existing target, `move` catches *any* OSError
        and falls back to `copy2` + `unlink`. Two real hazards ride on that fallback
        (#101) — it re-fails outright when an AV/indexer handle turns the rename into
        a sharing violation (WinError 5/32) and `copy2` then cannot open the same
        locked target, and it is non-atomic, so a crash mid-copy leaves a truncated
        stash. Staging a copy inside `dest` and `atomic_replace`-ing it onto the
        target overwrites in one step, carries #98's win32 retry, and — because the
        staging copy lives in `dest` — keeps the replace same-filesystem, preserving
        `shutil.move`'s cross-device tolerance.

        Both halves of the move are retried: Windows denies a delete against an open
        handle just as it denies a rename-over, so an unretried `unlink` would fail
        the run on the very hazard the replace now rides out. The order is
        replace-then-unlink because `_defer` calls this before the rollback and the
        `story-deferred` journal append — a failure here aborts the deferral, so it
        must be able to leave a duplicate spec, never a hole where the work was."""
