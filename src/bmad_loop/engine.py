        No-op when the tree is already at the attempt's baseline (nothing this
        attempt touched, ignoring orchestrator-owned artifact folders): neither a
        reset nor a pause is needed. This is also what lets the manual-recovery
        instructions terminate — after the operator resets and resumes, the
        now-clean tree skips straight through instead of re-pausing on the
        still-set ``baseline_commit``.

        A ``cause="resolved"`` re-drive is human-initiated (the operator ran the
        resolve workflow and re-armed the story), so it always auto-recovers and
        never pauses, regardless of ``scm.rollback_on_failure``. For the entire
        re-drive (``task.resolved_redrive``, latched at resume and cleared once the
        correction is committed) the BMAD artifact folders are treated as
        orchestrator-owned: excluded from the dirty check (the corrected spec must
        not read as a failed attempt) and preserved through every reset — so a
        later mid-re-drive retry/defer reset can't silently revert the correction.

        Otherwise (a stopped/abandoned attempt) the flag governs: OFF (default)
        leaves the working tree untouched and emits a bold manual-recovery notice
        that pauses the run (stop-and-wait); ON does a clean reset to baseline.
        Either way pre-existing untracked files are preserved; there is no blanket
        ``git clean``."""
        resolved = cause == "resolved"
