"""Interactive escalation resolution.

When a run pauses on a CRITICAL escalation the agent that raised it is already
gone (its tmux window was killed on completion), so there is nothing to talk
to. This module instead launches a *fresh* interactive agent — the
`bmad-loop-resolve` skill — attached to the caller's terminal, seeded with the
escalation detail and the frozen spec. The human and the agent disambiguate the
spec; the agent writes a `resolution.json` marker. The caller (cli.cmd_resolve)
then re-arms the story (runs.rearm_escalation) and resumes the run.

The orchestrator never parses the conversation: the durable output is the
edited frozen spec on disk plus the resolution marker.

    """The CRITICAL escalations recorded by this story's sessions, newest first,
    each DISTINCT escalation exactly once, paired with how many DISTINCT entries
    were withheld as already answered.

    ``start`` is ``task.escalations_resolved_upto`` — a position in the append-only
    ``task.sessions`` list, stamped by ``runs.rearm_escalation`` when a resolve cycle
    recorded a resolution (DW-11). Records BELOW it were already put to the human and
    answered, so their escalations are not shown again; the count of those the human
    can no longer see is returned for the operator, never written into
    ``context.json`` (the agent-facing contract is the unanswered set alone). The
    default 0 reproduces the pre-DW-11 walk byte-for-byte, which is what a
    pre-upgrade ``state.json`` deserializes to.

    Reads each session's tasks/<task_id>/ artifacts — the same files the engine
    inspected when it decided to pause. WHICH files is not spelled here: it is
    ``journal.TASK_CYCLE_ARTIFACTS``, the one list this reader shares with the two
    adapters that clear the same directory in ``start_session``, so a name added
    there reaches all three sites at once. Ordering is `reversed(task.sessions)`
    and, within a directory, that constant's own order — result.json before
    escalation.json; a duplicate keeps its FIRST occurrence's position, which is
    what preserves "newest first". Four guards, each for a defect this reader
    hit on the way to the operator:

    * ``seen_ids`` — ``task.sessions`` is append-only and a re-arm deliberately
      does NOT clear it, so state can carry two records under one ``task_id``.
      ``sweep._rearm_generation`` bumps the id namespace for new restarts but
      does not migrate records already persisted, and both records address the
      SAME mutable ``tasks/<id>/escalation.json`` — reading it per record
      attributes the abandoned cycle's escalation to the fresh session too.
      Open each directory once.
    * the content-keyed map — the sweep skill's own contract
      (``data/skills/bmad-loop-sweep/automation-mode.md``) tells a producer to
      write ``escalation.json`` and then mirror the same entries into
      ``result.json`` ``escalations``. That mirroring is deliberate and stays;
      the READER absorbs it, so a compliant producer is not shown to the human
      twice. The key is canonical JSON because the two copies are parsed
      separately — identity cannot see the mirroring and ``dict`` is unhashable
      — and ``setdefault`` makes the first occurrence win. De-duplication is
      global across the pass, not per directory; it removes only exact repeats,
      so a directory holding CRITICAL A in one file and A + B in the other still
      yields both.
    * the ``except`` tuple and shared list guard — ``build_context`` is an
      OBSERVATION path: a malformed artifact must cost its own contents and
      nothing more, never raise out to the interactive resolve command.
      ``UnicodeDecodeError`` is a ``ValueError``, not an ``OSError`` (the same
      rationale recorded on ``read_resolution`` above), and ``json.loads`` can
      also raise a plain ``ValueError`` when an integer exceeds Python's configured
      digit limit. Deeply nested input can raise ``RecursionError`` while either
      parsing the document or canonicalizing an entry, so both operations live
      under the same artifact-level guard. ``critical_escalations`` owns the
      list-only shape guard shared by every control-loop caller, so malformed
      ``escalations`` values contribute nothing here just as they do elsewhere.
      This reader re-checks the shape only AFTER that selector has run, and not
      to avoid a crash: the recheck decides whether the artifact counts as READ,
      so a wrong-shaped one reaches ``skipped`` instead of passing for an empty
      one — see that parameter's note below.
    * the ``stat`` classification and its ``S_ISREG`` check — deciding ABSENT from
      UNREADABLE cannot go through ``Path.is_file()``, whose error behavior splits by
      interpreter. Through 3.13 it re-raises anything outside
      ``pathlib._IGNORED_ERRNOS`` (ENOENT, ENOTDIR, EBADF, ELOOP), so an artifact under
      an EACCES directory raised straight out of this observation path and out of
      ``cmd_resolve`` — the one thing the bullet above promises never happens. On 3.14
      the body became ``os.path.isfile``, which swallows every error and calls that
      same artifact ABSENT, so nothing reached ``skipped`` and the caller stamped
      coverage over escalations it never read. ``stat`` answers with an errno instead:
      ENOENT and ENOTDIR are genuine absence and stay a bare ``continue`` — the
      dominant case, since a task dir normally holds only one of these names, and
      counting it as a skip would withhold coverage from every resolve cycle,
      permanently. Everything else — EACCES, EIO, ESTALE, EBADF, and now ELOOP — is an
      artifact that EXISTS and cannot be read, so it joins ``skipped`` under the same
      shown-side condition. ELOOP changing sides is deliberate, and it is the one
      reading this switch changes on EVERY interpreter rather than just one: a symlink
      cycle answered False through 3.13 because ELOOP(40) is IN the ignored tuple, and
      on 3.14 because ``os.path.isfile`` swallows it too. It is a degrade either way,
      and this module withholds coverage rather than laundering one into a durable
      claim. ``Path.stat`` is what makes a single ``except OSError`` enough here:
      MEASURED as ``OSError`` errno 40 on 3.11, 3.13 and 3.14 alike, unlike
      ``Path.resolve``, which raises ``RuntimeError`` on a loop under 3.11 and nothing
      at all under 3.13. ``S_ISREG`` survives the switch because ``is_file()`` answered
      False for a directory or a FIFO at that path while ``stat`` succeeds on both —
      without it a directory would reach ``read_text`` as an ``IsADirectoryError``, and
      a FIFO would BLOCK there forever, wedging the interactive command this reader
      serves.

    The watermark is a FIFTH concern layered onto that same single walk, not a
    second pass: ``reversed(task.sessions)`` reaches the unanswered tail first, so
    entries are routed into two content-keyed maps by the record's own index and the
    suppressed count is the answered keys that never appeared in the shown map. Two
    consequences are deliberate. An entry raised on BOTH sides of the watermark is
    shown and counted 0 — "not shown" is the claim the number makes, so it must never
    count something the operator can see. And ``start`` only SELECTS a map; nothing is
    indexed with it, so a watermark past the end of the list yields an empty shown
    list rather than an IndexError. A ``task_id`` repeated across the watermark is
    opened once by ``seen_ids``, at its newest occurrence — the shown side, the
    conservative direction.

    ``skipped`` is an OUT-parameter, and it exists because the degrade above is
    silent in exactly the place silence is unaffordable. An artifact dropped by the
    ``except`` costs its own escalations — but ``runs.rearm_escalation`` then stamps
    ``escalations_resolved_upto = len(task.sessions)``, which covers the session that
    artifact belonged to. A transient read fault (a network mount, a truncated write
    still in flight) therefore buries every escalation in it FOREVER: the next cycle
    reads the file fine and withholds it as already answered. The caller refuses to
    record coverage when this set is non-empty, which is the same
    observe-and-degrade contract this reader already keeps — it just stops the
    degrade from being laundered into a durable claim.

    It is an out-parameter rather than a third return value on purpose: the
    ``(list, int)`` pair is asserted by ~20 tests and read positionally by
    ``build_context``, and this signal has one consumer. Only skips on the SHOWN
    side are recorded — ``target is found`` — because those are the records the
    watermark would NEWLY cover. A skip below ``start`` was already covered by the
    previous cycle's watermark, so re-covering it buries nothing; it costs only the
    withheld COUNT, which claims nothing durable. Paths are collected rather than a
    bare tally so a duplicate artifact cannot inflate the answer."""

    The withheld count is for the OPERATOR's terminal (`cli.cmd_resolve` prints it) and
    is deliberately not a `context.json` field: the skill's contract is singular —
    resolve the escalation you are shown — and a count of things the agent cannot see is
    not something it can act on. It comes from the same single walk that produced the
    shown list, never from a second `_gather_escalations` call subtracting lengths.

    The unreadable count rides the SAME walk for the same reason, and it is a third
    return value rather than a second out-parameter because it has to cross a process's
    worth of control flow: `cli.cmd_resolve` is the only surface that can advance
    `escalations_resolved_upto` (the TUI hard-codes `resolution_recorded=False`), and a
    non-zero count there means this cycle showed the human strictly less than the

    `_gather_escalations`' `skipped` for why the alternative is permanent burial. Zero
    on every ordinary run, so the coverage path is unchanged whenever the run-dir reads
    cleanly.

    Blocks until the agent session exits. Returns whether the agent produced a
    resolution marker. The context file must already be written (build_context).

    Nothing consumes this session's ``task_id``: no task dir is created,
    ``interactive_argv`` ignores it, ``interactive_env`` does not export it, and no
    ``SessionRecord`` is appended. It is minted through ``engine._session_task_id``
    anyway because this was the FOURTH hand-mint site outside that chokepoint and
    there are now none. The property being restored is whole-composition
    sanitization: sanitizing ``story_key`` alone and concatenating the suffix AFTER
    can push a key already at ``MAX_SEGMENT`` back past it, and ``safe_segment``'s
    digest differs between the two orders. Since nothing reads the id, no collision
    follows from one — ``seq`` is a hardcoded 1 and several ``cmd_resolve`` paths
    return before the re-arm, so a later resolve of the same story may legitimately
    re-mint a byte-identical id.

    ``generation`` is required with no default for the reason that docstring gives —
    an implicit 0 is right in every run that never re-armed and wrong only on the one
    that did, so a default here would reproduce the defect at this seam. ``cmd_resolve``
    CALLS this before ``runs.rearm_escalation``, so the value it passes is the one still
    on disk, i.e. pre-bump. Not because the read is ordered against the bump: the re-arm
    reloads state and mutates its own copy, leaving the caller's ``task`` untouched.
