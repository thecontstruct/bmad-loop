"""Interactive escalation resolution.

When a run pauses on a CRITICAL escalation the agent that raised it is already
gone (its tmux window was killed on completion), so there is nothing to talk
to. This module instead launches a *fresh* interactive agent — the
`bmad-loop-resolve` skill — attached to the caller's terminal, seeded with the
escalation detail and the frozen spec. The human and the agent disambiguate the
spec; the agent writes a `resolution.json` marker. The caller (cli.cmd_resolve)
then re-arms the story (runs.rearm_escalation) and resumes the run.

The orchestrator never parses the conversation: the durable output is the
edited frozen spec on disk plus the resolution marker.

    re-mint a byte-identical id.
