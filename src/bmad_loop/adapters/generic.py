"""Generic coding-CLI driver: interactive sessions in tmux windows, observed via hooks.

Each pipeline step gets a fresh tmux window running the full interactive CLI
with the skill invocation as the initial prompt. Completion is detected
exclusively through hook-written event files (Stop/SessionEnd) plus the
presence of the skill-written result.json — the pane log's *contents* never
drive the wait loop (only tee'd for human debugging), though its *growth*
(mtime/size, never the bytes — see ``_log_activity_key``) is read as a liveness
signal to re-arm the dev-stall grace window. The one exception is post-mortem:
after the verdict and reconcile have settled, a single tail read of the log
classifies a transport-failure environment fault (#194, see
``_classify_env_fault``) — it labels the result, it never drives the wait loop.

Everything CLI-specific (binary, prompt rendering, bypass flags, usage
parser) comes from a declarative CLIProfile; each CLI's hook config registers
the shared relay script under its native event names but passes the canonical
event name as argv, so this adapter only ever sees canonical events. CLIs
without a SessionEnd hook (e.g. Codex) are covered by the window-death
fallback.

        deterministic proof THIS session wrote it (``transition_proven``), so it
        can synthesize on ONE terminal sighting instead of the 2-observation
        fingerprint.

        A pure sampling path, never a verdict path: it needs a launch snapshot to
        observe against, fires at most once per session (task_ids are unique;
        entries are never cleared), and any unreadable/torn read is a skipped
        sample (silent OSError return), never evidence. Blank/torn parses (``s ==
        ""``) and terminal states (``done``/``blocked``) are NOT recorded — a
        terminal frontmatter is the Stop harvest's business, and the launch status
        itself (the ``done`` a review re-opens) is not a transition. A transition
        that flips entirely between two ticks is simply missed, and the fallback
        keeps its conservative 2-observation path.

        Both sides of the comparison read through ``status_of``, so a blank/

        ``_reset_spec_for_review`` captures. That pairing is load-bearing and must

        which is neither blank nor terminal nor equal to the snapshot — a fabricated

        finalized to a terminal frontmatter ``status:`` without appending the
        ``## Auto Run Result`` marker the scan keys on. Without this, such a
        spec is invisible to the harvest: every Stop reads ``no-artifact``, the
        stall nudges re-invoke a skill that has already exited its workflow, and
        a finished story rides to timeout — where the engine's review RETRY
        strips the spec and reproduces the omission until the story defers.

        Trust model: a terminal frontmatter under a live window is weaker
        evidence than the marker, so the live path harvests only a fingerprint
        (path, mtime, status) that held stable across ``FM_FALLBACK_MIN_OBS``
        resultless Stops; a dead window (post-kill reconcile) harvests on one
        sighting, liveness having been settled by the kill. A recorded mid-session
        transition (#276 M2) is a third single-sighting route, live or dead: having
        observed this session drive the spec off its launch ``status:`` to a live
        non-terminal state (``in-review``) proves the terminal frontmatter it now
        carries is this session's own write, not a stale prior ``done``, so one
        terminal sighting suffices — the ``transition=`` flag on the synthesized
        crumb marks it. A transition that flips entirely between two ticks is simply
        missed, and this stays on the conservative 2-observation fingerprint.
        Several candidates mean the scan cannot know which spec is this session's —
        refuse to guess. The launch-snapshot hash (#276 M1) and the transition (M2)
        interact via ``_snapshot_verdict``: when the engine threaded a
        ``spec_snapshot`` (review sessions) and the candidate's bytes still hash
        equal to it, synthesis is deterministically REFUSED in every mode, including
        the dead window (the ``unmodified-since-launch`` verdict /
        ``frontmatter-unmodified-refused`` crumb) — the ``done`` spec re-opened for
        review, mtime-bumped but never re-driven. A recorded transition OUTRANKS the
        hash, though: a clean review can round-trip ``done -> in-review -> done`` back
        to the launch bytes while still omitting its marker, and the observed
        ``in-review`` proves it ran — so REFUSE fires only when NO transition was
        seen. Every synthesized result still runs the engine's full
        deterministic verify downstream, the same #61 trust model as the
        post-kill rescue. With this in place a marker-less ``done`` spec
        completes here and never reaches the review-timeout path, so the
        ``review.on_timeout`` salvage (#271) only ever sees the complementary
        case: a review that died with a NON-terminal frontmatter.

        Owns the give-up breadcrumb: exactly one of ``no-artifact``,
        ``ambiguous-frontmatter``, ``unmodified-since-launch``, or
        ``terminal-frontmatter-pending`` per wait=True pass (none on a harvest).
        A plain wait=False read (the crash path) is compare-only — it may harvest
        an already-stable fingerprint but never records observations or
        breadcrumbs; the hash gate is the one wait=False path that leaves a crumb,
        and only under a dead window (``frontmatter-unmodified-refused``).

        On the FIRST ``terminal-frontmatter-pending`` observation (wait=True, one
        candidate, not the hash-gate refusal, transition not yet proven) it also
        fires the #276 M4 contract nudge when ``limits.dev_contract_nudge`` is on:
        one ``CONTRACT_NUDGE_TEXT`` send asking the skill to append the marker it
        owed, then repair at the source rather than only synthesizing here. It is
        bounded by the never-cleared ``_contract_nudge_sent`` set (marked before
        the send, ``MultiplexerError`` swallowed) — exactly once per session,
        touching no stall counters, so an mtime bump that resets ``observations``
        to 1 never re-nudges. A compliant append is harvested by the ordinary
        marker scan on a later Stop, leaving synthesis as the backstop.

        ``only`` (#261) replaces the directory scan with the single spec the
        orchestrator knows this session owed: the candidate set becomes that file
        if it qualifies, else empty, and ``search_dirs`` is unused. Every gate
        below is unchanged — the point is purely that a foreign story's
        marker-less terminal spec, sitting in the same shared artifacts dir, is no
        longer a candidate at all, so the "refuse to guess between several" branch
        becomes unreachable.

        """Deterministic stories-mode read-back: resolve ``<spec-folder>/stories/
        <id>-*.md`` by id (never the mtime scan) and synthesize from it.

        ``BMAD_LOOP_SPEC_FOLDER`` carries the project-relative (or absolute) spec
        folder; rebase a relative one against ``spec.cwd`` exactly like
        ``_artifact_dirs`` so worktree isolation resolves inside the live checkout.
        A PRESENT or SENTINEL spec synthesizes (a blocked sentinel becomes a
        CRITICAL escalation → PAUSE, same as any block) — but only when the spec was
        (re)written by THIS session: like the mtime-scan path's ``since_ns`` floor, a
        spec whose mtime predates ``handle.launched_ns`` is a stale prior artifact
        (e.g. the dev's ``done`` spec a follow-up review session re-opens) and must
        not be read as this session's result. A still-PENDING spec, an AMBIGUOUS
        match (>1 file — an anomaly no wait can collapse; ``_pick_next`` re-classifies
        it into an actionable wedge), or a stale terminal spec → None (a result-less
        Stop the dev-stall grace handles).

        On a plan-halt leg (``BMAD_LOOP_PLAN_HALT`` set by the engine for a
        spec_checkpoint story's first dispatch) the skill HALTs at
        ``ready-for-dev``; pass ``plan_halt=True`` so synthesize treats that as a
        successful terminal (marked ``plan_halt``) rather than died-mid-flight.

        A review session also carries a launch ``spec_snapshot``, so before
        synthesizing this applies the shared ``_snapshot_verdict`` gate (#276 M1/M2):
        an unmodified-since-launch ``done`` spec with no observed transition is
        REFUSED (the ``unmodified-since-launch`` verdict), closing the same
        false-positive completion the mtime-scan fallback closes — a review that only
        bumped the mtime of the stripped launch spec no longer reads as done. A dev
        leg carries no snapshot → the gate is inert (mtime-floor accept). Identity is
        filesystem-based (``_same_spec``): under worktree isolation, if ``base``
        resolves into the worktree but the snapshot path is the main checkout the two
        differ and the gate stays inert — conservative (no false accept, just no
        extra protection)."""

        A session that wrote its terminal spec but whose final Stop event was
        lost ends ``stalled`` (nudge-unresponsive under a live window, where
        the artifact is advisory — the #48/#53 invariant), or ``timeout`` when
        no hook event ever arrived (hook misconfig, events-dir write failure —
        that path never arms the stall grace at all). Both verdicts discard
        the on-disk result solely because the window was alive to distrust;
        ``run()``'s kill has since settled that the way window death already
        vouches for the crash path. So: re-probe, and only on a provably dead
        window re-run the same read-back a delivered Stop would have run.

        The gate is deliberately stricter than the crash path's
        accept-any-terminal: the synthesis must be self-consistent
        (``status_consistent`` — "no active disagreement"; a blank frontmatter
        with prose ``done`` passes, exactly what a delivered Stop would have
        synthesized, and the engine's reconcile repairs the lag) and a
        *successful* terminal — ``done``, or the stories plan-halt leg (a
        deliberate widening of #61's literal done-only wording). A ``blocked``
        terminal is never rescued: it carries no finished work, and
        blocked-plus-nudge-unresponsive is weak evidence of anything. Every
        rescue still runs the engine's full deterministic verify downstream,
        so a bogus upgrade degrades into an ordinary verify-failed retry. A
        cap-exhausted injected-workflow stall whose marker landed before the
        kill is rescued by the same trust model. ``over_budget`` joins the set
        (#158): an artifact the wrap-up nudge flushed at kill-time is honored
        the same way.

        ``aborted`` joins it too (#319): an operator's hard stop kills the
        window mid-wait, so a Stop event that had already landed — or was one
        tick away — is never read, leaving exactly the same evidence problem.
        The same trust model settles it: a provably dead window plus a
        self-consistent *successful* terminal plus proof-of-work means the
        session did finish, and discarding that work would misreport what
        happened rather than be cautious about it. The upgrade to
        ``completed`` does NOT resume the run — the engine re-reads the
        hard-stop file after saving the rescued session and stops there, so a
        rescue records the finished work and still honors the stop."""
