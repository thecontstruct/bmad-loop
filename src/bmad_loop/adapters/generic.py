"""Generic coding-CLI driver: interactive sessions in tmux windows, observed via hooks.

Each pipeline step gets a fresh tmux window running the full interactive CLI
with the skill invocation as the initial prompt. Completion is detected
exclusively through hook-written event files (Stop/SessionEnd) plus the
presence of the skill-written result.json — the pane log's *contents* are
never parsed for control flow (only tee'd for human debugging), though its
*growth* (mtime/size, never the bytes — see ``_log_activity_key``) is read as
a liveness signal to re-arm the dev-stall grace window.

Everything CLI-specific (binary, prompt rendering, bypass flags, usage
parser) comes from a declarative CLIProfile; each CLI's hook config registers
the shared relay script under its native event names but passes the canonical
event name as argv, so this adapter only ever sees canonical events. CLIs
without a SessionEnd hook (e.g. Codex) are covered by the window-death
fallback.
