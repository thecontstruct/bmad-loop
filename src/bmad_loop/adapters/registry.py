"""Coding-CLI adapter registry — the out-of-tree extension seam for the CLI axis.

The transport axis (:mod:`~.multiplexer`) has long been extensible out-of-tree:
a backend registers through ``register_multiplexer`` and a co-installed package
is discovered via the ``bmad_loop.mux_backends`` entry-point group. This module
is the same seam for the *other* axis — which adapter **class** drives a coding
CLI. A CLI that fits the tmux-injection + hook-signal transport still needs no
Python at all (drop a TOML :class:`~.profile.CLIProfile` and run ``bmad-loop
probe-adapter``); this registry is for a CLI that needs a whole new adapter
subclass (the shipped example is the HTTP/SSE ``opencode-http`` adapter, which no
tmux profile can host).

An adapter *kind* is selected by **data**: ``profile.adapter`` names the kind, and
:func:`get_adapter_kind` resolves it. Two registration-time dataclasses carry the
family:

- :class:`AdapterKind` — ``name`` + ``needs_mux`` (does the family drive a
  terminal multiplexer?) + ``load``, a lazy thunk returning the builder. The thunk
  is why registration, validation (``known_adapter_kinds``) and listing
  (``detect_adapters``) never import a heavy adapter module — nor an optional
  dependency like ``httpx``, which only the opencode family pulls in at
  construction.
- :class:`AdapterBuilder` — the ``plain`` class, the ``_DevSynthesisMixin``-composed
  ``dev`` class (both share the ``(*args, paths, **kwargs)`` dev ``__init__``), and
  the family's construction-failure exception type(s) (``()`` = none;
  ``(OpencodeServerError,)`` for the HTTP family, which fails loud when its server
  can't spawn). ``runsetup.make_adapters`` converts a raised ``construct_error``
  into a ``SystemExit``.

Bundled kinds register from :func:`_load_builtin_adapters` (:data:`GENERIC`,
:data:`OPENCODE_HTTP`); out-of-tree kinds arrive at import time, triggered by the
``bmad_loop.adapters`` entry-point scan in :func:`_load_external_adapters` — so a
pip/uv co-installed adapter package is selectable with no config step. Builtins
are seeded by :func:`register_adapter` itself, so an external can never shadow a
bundled name however early its import lands. A broken third-party distribution
degrades to a recorded, surfaced reason (:func:`external_adapter_errors`) and can
never break selection — one reason per failing distribution, kept even when two of
them advertise the same entry-point name (:mod:`~.entrypoints`).

**Two deliberate asymmetries versus the multiplexer seam** (this is not a
copy-paste omission):

- *No process-wide cache / no ``cache_clear``.* The multiplexer is a single
  process-wide singleton behind an ``lru_cache``; adapters are built **per run**
  in ``runsetup.make_adapters``, which keeps its own ``by_cfg`` cache keyed on
  ``(resolved-config, synthesizes)``. Selection here is a pure registry lookup, so
  there is nothing to cache and :func:`register_adapter` invalidates nothing.
- *No ``configure_*`` / ``matches(platform)`` / platform defaults.* The multiplexer
  is chosen by a policy knob and a ``sys.platform`` predicate; an adapter kind is
  chosen by the ``profile.adapter`` field alone. There is no host-dependent
  auto-selection and no persisted choice to install, so none of that machinery
  exists — ``get_adapter_kind(name)`` fails loud on an unknown name rather than
  falling back.

    failures are recorded in ``_EXTERNAL_ERRORS`` (surfaced by ``bmad-loop

    not raised. The loaded-flag is set up front: a third-party import failure is
    not transient, and retrying on every resolution would re-import (and re-fail)
    each time — mirroring the multiplexer's external scan.

    A recorded failure does NOT mean the entry point registered nothing: a module
    that registers kind A and then raises while registering kind B leaves A
    registered and selectable. Deliberate — unwinding would mean tracking which
    names a half-run import claimed, and a kind that registered cleanly is usable

    Entry points are visited in (name, distribution) order. ``importlib.metadata``
    yields them in distribution-discovery order, which varies with ``sys.path``, so
    without an explicit sort two hosts carrying the same packages could resolve a
    collision differently — first-wins would be a fact about the install rather
    than about the packages.

    The distribution belongs in the key because the name alone is NOT a total
    order. ``entry_points(group=...)`` does not dedup across distributions, so two
    packages advertising the same entry-point name come back as two entries, and
    ``sorted`` is stable — a name-only key resolves that tie straight back into
    ``sys.path`` order. That tie is the whole case the sort exists for: a package
