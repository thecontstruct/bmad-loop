"""Coding-CLI adapter seam.

Adapters differ along three orthogonal capability axes, declared as class
attributes so the engine can reason about transport quality instead of
treating every CLI as a dumb terminal:

- injection:   how a prompt reaches the CLI
               "tmux-initial-prompt" | "launch-flag" | "http"
- observation: how turn/session completion is detected
               "hook-signal" | "sse" | "stream-json" | "transcript-poll"
- state:       where session state is readable
               "local-jsonl" | "local-json-tree" | "remote"
