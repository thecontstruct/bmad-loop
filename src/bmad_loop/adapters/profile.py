"""Declarative CLI profiles for the generic tmux adapter.

A profile captures everything that differs between coding CLIs that share the
tmux-injection + hook-signal transport: binary name, how the canonical
"/skill args" prompt is rendered, bypass flags, hook registration (a config
dialect + an event-name map), and which usage parser reads the transcript.

Built-in profiles ship as packaged TOML (bmad_loop/data/profiles/*.toml) and
project-local TOML files in <project>/.bmad-loop/profiles/*.toml overlay them
(same name overrides, new names extend) — adding a CLI that clones an
existing hook dialect needs no Python.

An out-of-tree package advertises additional profiles under the
``bmad_loop.profiles`` entry-point group (:func:`load_profiles` scans it): the
companion to the ``bmad_loop.adapters`` registry (:mod:`~.registry`), so a
co-installed adapter package ships both its class and the profile that selects
it with zero project config. Precedence is packaged < entry-point < project (a
project TOML always wins). A broken entry point degrades to a recorded reason
(:func:`external_profile_errors`), never a crash — one per failing distribution,
kept even when two of them advertise the same name (:mod:`~.entrypoints`).

Which adapter *class* drives a profile is the ``adapter`` field, resolved against
the :mod:`~.registry` — it is read here but intentionally **not** checked against
the set of registered kinds at parse time (an unknown kind is caught at
construction and by ``validate``, against the live registry, never a hardcoded
set). Its *shape* is still enforced here, like every other field.

Both routes into the profile map — the TOML parser and the entry-point scan —
converge on :func:`_validate_profile`, so a Python package cannot install a
profile state a TOML author would have been refused.

    Before the registry, ``hooks.dialect`` WAS the class selector: ``make_adapters``
    sent every hookless profile to the opencode HTTP adapters and everything else to

    (``<project>/.bmad-loop/profiles/*.toml``, same name overrides), and the way to
    tweak the opencode profile's ``binary``/``env``/``model`` was to copy the
    packaged one — which carried no ``adapter`` key, because the key did not exist.
    Taking the dataclass default for those files would silently move a working
    hookless run onto tmux, where it launches the CLI in a window and waits out

    and ``validate`` stays green, because every check it would trip keys on
    ``hookless`` too. So reproduce the old dispatch instead of defaulting.
