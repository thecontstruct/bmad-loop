"""OpenCode driver: sessions over the local HTTP server, no tmux, no hooks.

OpenCode (opencode.ai) is client/server: its TUI is just a client of a local
HTTP server (``opencode serve``) exposing an OpenAPI 3.1 API. This adapter
drives sessions entirely over that API (``injection="http"``,
``observation="sse"``).

API contract — every fact below was pinned live against the real 1.18.2
binary (2026-07-16; the full probe record and the archived OpenAPI spec live
in git history, commit b85d8ca / PR #167). This list wins over memory:

- Readiness target is ``GET /global/health`` (``/health`` is the web-UI SPA
  shell). With ``OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD`` set *every* endpoint 401s, health
  included — basic-auth username is literally ``opencode``; Bearer is
  rejected.
- SSE ``GET /event``: flat ``data:``-only frames, first frame
  ``server.connected``, ``server.heartbeat`` ≈ every 10 s, no server-side
  filtering — clients filter by ``properties.sessionID``.
- ``session.idle`` fires even when aborting an idle session, so an idle event
  alone is never proof a turn ran — it must pair with an assistant message
  whose ``time.completed`` post-dates the last prompt sent.
- Poll fallback ``GET /session/status`` returns a ``{sessionID: status}`` map
  in which idle sessions are simply **absent** — the rule is "absent ⇒ not
  busy", never "wait for idle".
- Per-prompt ``model`` is the object form ``{providerID, modelID}``; the
  ``"provider/model"`` string form belongs only to the config-file ``model``
  key.
- ``OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT`` outranks the project's ``opencode.json``
  (applied as a final local-scope merge over all config files).
- Hermetic skills need ``OPENCODE_DISABLE_EXTERNAL_SKILLS=1`` **plus**
  ``skills.paths=["<worktree>/.claude/skills"]`` inside the config content —
  by default every server also sees the operator's personal
  ``~/.claude/skills`` and ``~/.agents/skills``.
- ``opencode serve`` survives parent SIGKILL (reparents to init and keeps
  serving); SIGTERM exits it cleanly.
- All ``time.*`` fields are epoch **milliseconds**; ``POST /session/:id/abort``
  returns ``200 true`` even when nothing is running.

``/event`` frame types the run-log renderer reads — pinned by a second live
probe of 1.18.2 (2026-07-25, 388 frames over 5 turns across two servers; the
full evidence table is posted on PR #279). Cross-checked against the server's
own OpenAPI at ``GET /doc``, whose ``Event`` union has 89 variants and is the
static contract — worth re-dumping on any version bump:

- ``message.updated`` — turn metadata only, no text. Carries ``info.id`` +
  ``info.role``; **re-emits out of order** (a stale re-emit for the user
  message lands mid-assistant-turn), so role must be keyed by message id, never
  tracked as "last role seen".
- ``message.part.updated`` — **complete-once, NOT cumulative.** A part fires
  exactly twice: once at creation with ``text: ""``, then once carrying the
  full final text. Held at 4 / 711 / 5689 chars (2 fires each, 1 non-empty).
  Rendering on this frame therefore yields one clean line per statement, with
  no de-duplication needed. **Tool execution also surfaces here** — and only
  here — as ``part.type == "tool"`` with ``part.tool`` and a ``state`` whose
  ``status`` steps pending → running → terminal (``state.input`` throughout,
  ``state.output`` on ``completed``, ``state.error`` on ``error``). Tool parts
  carry no ``part.text``, so the tool branch must sit ABOVE the empty-text
  bail-out in ``_inline_line`` to be reachable at all. ``ToolState`` is a
  4-variant union (pending / running / completed / error), so rendering on the
  terminal pair is exhaustively once-per-tool-call; ``error`` is included from
  the static contract (no tool failed during the live probe) so a failed call
  cannot vanish from the transcript.
- ``message.part.delta`` — the separate per-token stream. At 5689 chars its 50
  deltas concatenate **byte-exactly** to the single ``part.updated`` text, so
  it is pure redundancy: never rendered inline, and excluded from the SSE trace
  (``logs/`` is never trimmed by retention).
- ``command.executed`` — the **slash-command** surface, kept as that and nothing
  more. It does **not** fire for agent tool use: 0 frames across live ``bash`` /
  ``write`` / ``read`` / ``edit`` calls. Payload is ``name`` / ``arguments`` /
  ``messageID`` / ``sessionID`` (all required, so it needs no allowlist).
- ``file.edited`` — payload is exactly ``{"file": "/abs/path"}``, schema-pinned
  ``additionalProperties: false`` over that one key, so it carries **no
  ``sessionID``** and the ``properties.sessionID`` filter would drop it before
  either sink. It is reachable only through the explicit ``_SESSIONLESS_TYPES``
  allowlist, sound here only because bmad-loop runs one server per session.
  ``file.watcher.updated`` is session-less too and deliberately NOT allowlisted
  (see that constant).
- ``permission.asked`` — the ask frame. There is **no ``permission.updated``** in
  1.18.2. Payload is a ``permission`` **string** plus ``patterns`` /
  ``metadata`` / ``always`` / ``tool`` / ``id`` / ``sessionID`` — not a nested
  object with ``type`` / ``pattern``.
- ``permission.replied`` — carries **``reply``**, not ``response`` (plus
  ``sessionID`` / ``requestID``).
- ``permission.v2.asked`` / ``permission.v2.replied`` exist in the union and are
  **deliberately not consumed**: neither was seen live, and the v2 ask is a
  different payload (``action`` / ``resources`` / ``save`` / ``metadata`` /
  ``source``), so a branch for it would be written from the schema alone —
  exactly the guess that made the three corrections above necessary. The v2
  reply is shape-identical to the v1 one, but consuming it without the ask would
  log a decision with no request. Add both together once a live sighting pins
  what ``action`` / ``resources`` actually hold.
- There is **no ``tool.call`` / ``tool.response``** on this surface —
  confirmed both statically in the 89-variant union and live.

Transport shape (the settled design drivers):

- **One ``opencode serve`` per session.** The API has no per-session env, and
  the ``BMAD_LOOP_*`` contract must reach tool subprocesses via the server
  process env — so each session gets its own server spawned with
  ``cwd=spec.cwd`` and the session env. Ports are OS-assigned free ports,
  re-picked on a bind race.
- **Config injected via ``OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT``** (outranks the project's
  ``opencode.json``): a blanket permission allow (the bypass-flags
  analogue), the hermetic-skills recipe above (project ``.claude/skills``
  only — without it every session sees the operator's personal skills), and
  the policy model when set. A per-session ``OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD`` makes
  the health poll self-discriminating against a foreign server on a reused
  port and keeps other local processes from driving an allow-all server.
- **SSE ``session.idle`` ≙ the Stop hook**, filtered to this session's id —
  child/subagent sessions share the stream and emit their own idles. SSE is
  lossy upstream, so a silent or reconnecting stream degrades to an HTTP poll
  (``GET /session/status`` + message-level proof-of-work): an idle event alone
  is NOT proof a turn ran (abort emits one on an idle session),
  so the fallback demands an assistant message completed *after* the last
  prompt this adapter sent. OpenCode timestamps are epoch **milliseconds**.
- **Server death ≙ window death** (``crashed``, landed artifact honored);
  stall verdicts under a live server pin ``accept_result=False`` — the
  #48/#53 artifact-distrust invariant, unchanged.
- **Usage is read over HTTP before teardown** (server state is sqlite, not a
  readable file tree): assistant-message token sums, stashed by session id,
  raw messages dumped to ``tasks/<task_id>/messages.json`` as the transcript.
  Child-session (subagent) tokens are not counted — the API scopes messages
  per session.
- ``opencode serve`` survives parent death, so teardown is
  authoritative: kill in ``run()``'s finally plus an atexit sweep. On Windows
  the binary is an npm ``.cmd`` shim, so the kill goes straight to the
  process-tree force-kill while the wrapper is still alive to enumerate.

        plus ``flush()`` — so it always lands as a whole line at EOF.

        Every event-type string below, and the payload shape each branch reads,

        records the role under the message id so the following

        id (not "last role seen") is required because ``message.updated``
        frames arrive out of order: a re-emit for the user message lands mid-
        assistant-turn and would otherwise flip the prefix to ``user:`` on the
