"""Terminal-multiplexer seam.

The coding-CLI adapter (:class:`~.base.CodingCLIAdapter`) abstracts *which CLI*
to drive and how its prompts/hooks work. This module abstracts the orthogonal
**transport** axis: how sessions, windows, and panes are created, observed, and
torn down. The bundled backends are tmux
(:class:`~.tmux_backend.TmuxMultiplexer`) and the native-Windows psmux
(:class:`~.psmux_backend.PsmuxMultiplexer`); every other backend lives out-of-tree
(the reference is the herdr adapter, https://github.com/pbean/bmad-loop-adapter-herdr)
and slots in without the rest of the codebase shelling out to ``tmux`` directly.

``TerminalMultiplexer`` is the contract a backend author implements. Operation
names mirror today's call sites verbatim so the migration is mechanical. Backends
register themselves through :func:`register_multiplexer` (bundled ones from
:func:`_load_builtin_backends`, which :func:`register_multiplexer` seeds first so
a bundled name keeps first-wins no matter who registers earliest; out-of-tree
ones at import time — usually the ``bmad_loop.mux_backends`` entry-point scan in
:func:`_load_external_backends`, so a pip/uv co-installed adapter package is
selectable with no config step, but *any* import reaches it, a plugin's
``[python]`` module included); the process-wide backend is selected by registry
and returned by :func:`get_multiplexer`.

Selection precedence (issue #87): the ``BMAD_LOOP_MUX_BACKEND`` env var, then the
policy ``[mux] backend`` choice (installed once per CLI invocation via
:func:`configure_multiplexer`), then the platform default when registered and
available, then the first registered backend that matches the platform and is
available, then the historical fallback (first platform match regardless of
availability, bottoming out at tmux). :func:`detect_multiplexers` enumerates the
registry for ``bmad-loop mux`` and the ``validate`` preflight.

        **The registry-namespace seam concept.** A *registry* is wherever a
        multiplexer keeps the per-session addressing state its verbs resolve a
        target through: for psmux, the ``PSMUX_DATA_DIR`` directory of
        ``.port``/``.key`` files, one per session. It is a namespace, not a
        filter — a session in registry A is not merely hidden from a verb aimed
        at registry B, it is unaddressable from it. bmad-loop aims psmux at a
        per-project root (``runs.mux_registry_root``), which is what makes this
        method necessary: sessions created before that root existed are in
        psmux's default registry, addressable only by a backend pointed there.

        Each element must be an independent instance bound to its registry, and

        a TUI worker thread running beside other threads issuing ordinary verbs,
        and a global swap would silently aim one of *those* at the wrong
        registry — the same live-session-reads-as-gone failure the per-project
        root exists to prevent.

        A porting note for a new OS or multiplexer: if the transport has no such
        namespace, inherit this default and nothing else changes. If it does,
        the seam wants the derivation in ``runs`` (keyed on the project, never on
