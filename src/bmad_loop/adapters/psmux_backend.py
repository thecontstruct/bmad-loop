"""Native-Windows psmux backend for the terminal-multiplexer seam.

psmux (a Rust/ConPTY tmux re-implementation) speaks the tmux CLI through its
own distinctly-named ``psmux`` binary, so this leaf points the base's spawn
seam at that name, keeps every argv construction in :mod:`.tmux_base`, and
swaps only the shell dialect (PowerShell instead of POSIX sh) via the base's
hooks, plus the handful of behaviors where psmux diverges from tmux:
window-level ``-e`` is accepted but silently dropped, an attaching
``new-session`` is refused by a nesting guard when run from inside a psmux
pane, ``kill-session`` ignores the ``=name`` exact-match form, a quoted
command string does not survive psmux's outer re-parse (so shell source
travels as ``pwsh -EncodedCommand``), and ``pipe-pane`` strips every
dash-flag token from the piped command (so the log sink travels as a
positional sidecar ``.ps1``). Window ids are minted per server (one
server per session), so every id this backend hands back —
``new_window``, ``list_window_ids``, ``new_parked_window``, the
``window_id`` columns of ``list_windows``, and ``current_window_id`` — is
session-qualified to ``session:@N`` (degrading to the bare id only where
the grammar cannot carry the session name — see ``_qualified_window_id``)
and routes to the owning server from any caller (psmux/psmux#483).
``select_window`` is the one verb that
cannot take that form: psmux validates a scoped target's window part
CLI-side against window index/name only, so the override resolves the id
back to an index first. Per-window user options do not exist at all, so
the window-option verbs, the ``@``-prefixed columns of ``list_windows``
and the parked trailer route through a substitute channel — see the
``per-window option channel (#310)`` block below for the model and its
rules. Session-scoped options need no such substitute — one server per
session means that server's single map is the session's — but they cross
the same lossy control line, so ``set_session_option`` gates its value on
the same transportability rule (#320). ``detach-client`` and
``switch-client`` report dispatch rather than effect — every arm exits 0
whether or not a client moved — so both seam booleans are measured against
the session's attached-client count instead of read off the exit code; see
the ``client verbs: observed effect (#317)`` block. ``available()``
additionally gates on the reported version: psmux releases up to 3.3.6 kill
recycled PIDs during pane/session teardown without a process-identity check,
which can take down an unrelated long-lived process mid-run. The psmux
behaviors cited in this
module were read from the psmux source at tag ``v3.3.7``. See
:mod:`.multiplexer` for the contract.

    # (`@bmad_project__blw@3` for `@3`). Two rules keep it correct —
    #   - `-t <session>` on every out-of-pane write and read (the parked
    #     trailer runs in-pane and rides `$TMUX` instead — see
    #     `_parked_trailer`). psmux picks the server from the target, and
    #     without an explicit session it falls back to $TMUX / most-recent —
    #     i.e. some other server. The session comes from the qualified ids
    #     this backend already mints, which is why #310 lands after #291.
    #   - the key carries the seam-owned `__blw@` marker plus the full id
    #     (`__blw@3`, never bare digits): the ctl server loads the user's
    #     psmux config, so the map is shared, and the generic cleanup sweeps
    #     delete every key matching their suffix. No real-world naming
    #     convention collides with the marker — a user option only matches by
    #     deliberately imitating the seam (`@theme__blw@3` would; the old
    #     hazard shapes `@theme_@3` / `@color_3` cannot) — and it keeps caller
    #     names out of the backend (a bmad-owned prefix guard would hardcode
    #     them). The session stays out of the key; routing already carries it.
    #
    # Builtin window options keep the base's `-w` argv — psmux accepts those
    # allowlisted names (only `automatic-rename` has true per-window storage;
    # the rest read the global value), and rerouting them into this channel
    # would break reads that work today.

    # A window target as the seam composes it: `session:@N`, `=session:@N`, or

    #
    # psmux's client verbs report *dispatch*, not effect. At ``v3.3.7`` both CLI
    # arms end in ``send_control(cmd)?; return Ok(())``, so the only nonzero exit
    # is an unreachable session server: ``detach-client`` succeeds with zero
    # clients attached (and a flag-less detach is promoted server-side to
    # detach-all), and *no* form of ``switch-client`` — ``-t`` included —
    # carries a server reply. Later builds narrow this but do not close it: a
    # response path landed after the tag and only for ``-t``, leaving ``-l``
    # exit-0 regardless. Taking those exit codes as the seam's booleans is the
    # rc-0 no-op (#228) reached through Python instead of a shell fallback, and
    # it is what ``tui.launch.return_attached_client`` would consume to decide a
    # human has been handed their terminal back.
    #
    # So the exit code is discarded and the effect is measured: count the
    # clients attached to this session before and after the verb, and answer on
    # the DELTA. Never on an absolute count — a ``-t`` read against a session
    # whose server is gone answers from whichever server the fallback picks, so
    # "zero attached" on its own proves nothing (#315). A drop cannot be
    # manufactured that way: it needs two successful reads of the same session,
    # the first of them nonzero.
    #
    # Unobservable answers False, never a vacuous True. For the detach that is
    # safe in both directions — the caller's UNREACHABLE and RETURNED agree that
    # nobody is left at this terminal, and the only cost is the parked trailer
    # re-issuing a detach that no-ops. For the switch it is also the truth
    # today: the switch leg is inert at 3.3.7 (psmux/psmux#483), so no client
    # ever moves. When upstream lands that fix the probe reports it without a
    # code change here — which is why this measures rather than hardcoding.
    #
    # Residue: a switch whose target pane lives in THIS session moves the client
    # between windows without changing the session's attached count, so it reads
    # as no effect. Reachable only when the return target was recorded from
    # inside a control-session window; the caller then keeps prompting, which is
    # the safe direction.
