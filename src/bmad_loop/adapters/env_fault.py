"""Post-mortem environment-fault classification, shared across transports (#194).

After a session's verdict and reconcile have settled, a single tail read of the
session log can reclassify a non-completed verdict as an *environment fault* —
the CLI never got usable work out of the provider, so the attempt proved nothing
about the story. The engine routes that to a PAUSE (``env_fault_pause_reason``)
instead of charging a dev attempt, and re-arming resets the budget.

This lives in its own module rather than on one adapter because the signal is
**transport-agnostic**: every adapter that writes a per-task diagnostic log can
be classified from it, whatever produced the bytes. Which file that is per
adapter is named by ``ENV_FAULT_LOG_SUFFIX``: the tmux adapters tee a pane
capture to ``logs/<task_id>.log`` (``mux.pipe_pane``); the opencode HTTP adapter
redirects the ``opencode serve`` process's own stdout/stderr to
``logs/<task_id>.server.out`` — NOT its ``.log``, which is a model-written
conversation transcript. Keeping the classifier attached to a single adapter is
what let #194 ship covering only half the adapters, so the next sibling adapter
inherits this instead of re-omitting it.

Host-class contract: ``self.profile`` (a ``CLIProfile``), ``self.logs_dir``, and
``_note_lifecycle`` (from ``_ResultFileMixin``). Mix in alongside that mixin.

Note the two log flavors differ in how *dirty* they are, which is why the
shipped patterns are anchored the way they are. A tmux pane capture contains the
model's own output — a story that implements rate limiting will print "429" and
"quota" in ordinary healthy work — whereas the opencode server log carries only
server and provider lines. That difference sets the bar per profile, and the two
bars are NOT the same. On a pane capture a pattern must reproduce a COMPLETE
captured CLI error sentence: an error-shaped token plus a cause on the same line
is precisely the shape a story writing ABOUT the error emits, so that weaker rule
classified 44 of this repo's own tracked lines and had to be withdrawn (#507).
The opencode server log tolerates the anchor-plus-cause form only because the
model cannot write to it. Seed either from a captured line, never a plausible
one; the profiles' own comments carry the provenance and
tests/test_env_fault_patterns.py pins both halves.
