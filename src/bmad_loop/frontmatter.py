"""Pure spec-frontmatter parsing: read the YAML ``---``…``---`` block, normalize
the status token, and rewrite ``status:`` in place.

Zero git/subprocess dependencies (only stdlib + PyYAML) so pure domain modules
(``stories``, ``devcontract``) can read spec status without importing ``verify``
and dragging in its whole git surface (assessment finding F-1). ``verify``
re-exports these names, so every existing ``verify.<name>`` / ``from .verify
import <name>`` call site stays valid. (The same docstring rule bars importing
``platform_util`` here — it pulls in ``subprocess`` — so this module's writes are
a plain ``write_bytes``, not ``atomic_replace``: byte-preserving, but not atomic.
``read_bytes().decode`` on the way in for the same reason — ``read_text``'s
universal-newline translation would hand the writer an all-LF copy of a CRLF
spec, and every line ending in the file would be relaid on the way back out.)

READER AND WRITER DEGRADE IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS, deliberately. `read_frontmatter`
turns an unparseable or undecodable block into ``{}``: it runs on the observation
path, where the orchestrator's job is to classify what it finds, and every status
gate then reads ``""`` and answers with a clean retry. `set_frontmatter_status`
runs on the *repair* path and does the opposite — when it can see a status it
cannot safely rewrite, it RAISES `FrontmatterWriteError`. That is AGENTS.md's
"observation may degrade, repair writes must raise", and it is what makes a
``False`` return mean one thing only: there was nothing to change.

    Enumerating the shapes a line scan must not touch is a losing game — a flow
    mapping, a block scalar, a value continued on the next line, an anchor
    another key aliases, a nested key of the same name, the key quoted inside
    ANOTHER key's literal block. Each of those had the old scanner either write
    nothing or corrupt the spec, and every enumeration written for this (mine and
    both reviewers') missed shapes the next one caught.

    So this does not widen a pattern. It makes the trial edit, re-parses it with
    ``yaml.safe_load`` as an ORACLE, and keeps it only if the block still parses
    as a mapping, its top-level ``key`` is exactly ``value``, and **every other
    key is unchanged**. YAML is never used as a serializer — the edit stays the
    formatting-preserving single-line replacement — so one gate replaces six and
    it also rejects shapes nobody has enumerated. The other-keys comparison is
    the half no pattern-widening design has: it is what catches an edit with the
    right effect on ``key`` and a wrong effect somewhere else.

    Candidates are ITERATED, not broken on at the first match. That is what fixes
    the wrong-target write: a decoy line inside another key's literal block fails
    verification and the real key is still reached.

    The parse is of the block the READER would see, so the two agree on what is
    there. An unparseable block raises rather than returning None: the reader
    degrades it to ``{}`` because observation may, but a writer that concluded
    "no status here" from a block it could not read would report success for a
    spec it never touched.

    ``insert`` adds the key as the block's last line when the reader sees no such
    top-level key — what `verify.set_frontmatter_field` and
    `devcontract.reset_spec_status` need and `set_frontmatter_status` must never
    do. It is gated on the READER's view rather than on a scan miss, which is the
    other half of the same defect: a scan that missed a quoted key then appended
    a SECOND one, and the file ended up with two. The inserted line takes the
    ending of the line it follows (`_last_line_ending`), so an insert cannot
