"""Pure spec-frontmatter parsing: read the YAML ``---``…``---`` block, normalize
the status token, and rewrite ``status:`` in place.

No git dependency, so a pure domain module can read spec status without importing
``verify`` and dragging in its whole git surface (assessment finding F-1).
``stories`` still collects on that: ``import bmad_loop.stories`` genuinely leaves
``bmad_loop.verify`` out of ``sys.modules``. ``devcontract`` no longer does — it
imports ``verify`` directly for `read_frontmatter` and `operator_actions_of` — so
the rule now has one beneficiary, not the two it was written for. ``verify``
re-exports these names either way, so every existing ``verify.<name>`` /
``from .verify import <name>`` call site stays valid.

That rule is about ``verify``, NOT about ``subprocess``: this module imports
``platform_util`` (#379), which pulls ``subprocess`` in, and both named modules
already paid that cost anyway — ``devcontract`` imports it directly and
``stories`` reaches it through ``deferredwork``. So the writes here are atomic as
well as byte-verbatim: ``read_bytes().decode`` in, ``atomic_write_bytes`` out.
The byte path is load-bearing on its own — ``read_text``'s universal-newline
translation would hand the writer an all-LF copy of a CRLF spec, and every line
ending in the file would be relaid on the way back out.

READER AND WRITER DEGRADE IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS, deliberately. `read_frontmatter`
turns an unparseable or undecodable block into ``{}``: it runs on the observation
path, where the orchestrator's job is to classify what it finds, and every status
gate then reads ``""`` and answers with a clean retry. `set_frontmatter_status`
runs on the *repair* path and does the opposite — when it can see a status it
cannot safely rewrite, it RAISES `FrontmatterWriteError`. That is AGENTS.md's
"observation may degrade, repair writes must raise", and it is what makes a
``False`` return mean one thing only: there was nothing to change.

    ``status_of`` and ``operator_actions_of`` are field-generic — they read one key

    contract specifically: the skill stamps ``baseline_revision``, the orchestrator's
    own result.json says ``baseline_commit``, and a spec re-armed by
    ``runs.rearm_escalation`` can carry both. A bare ``baseline_of`` would read as
    universal when it is not (#716).

    ``baseline_revision`` WINS whenever it is non-empty, even against a

    devcontract's synthesized result and verify's baseline-match gate — read
    through here so the two cannot drift, and the two byte-identical
    ``fm.get("baseline_commit", fm.get("baseline_revision", ""))`` expressions
    this replaces had the precedence the other way round. That flip is deliberate
    and tightening: the legacy key is a leftover the re-arm never removes, so
    ranking it first let a stale sha silently outrank the fresh value the skill
    had just written, killing the gate on an attempt that did everything right.

    An EMPTY legacy key is skipped rather than returned. ``dict.get``'s default
    only fires on a MISSING key, so ``baseline_commit: ''`` used to be selected and

    disabled the baseline-match gate outright.

    A YAML-null value (a bare ``baseline_commit:`` line, or ``: null``) is treated

    token ``"None"``, which is not a sha but IS non-empty, so it would flow into
    the gate as a claim and fail an attempt that never made one (#358). A YAML
    BOOLEAN is the same trap class and is skipped with it: PyYAML resolves ``no``,
    ``off`` and ``false`` to ``False`` (``yes``/``on``/``true`` to ``True``), and
    ``str(False)`` is the token ``"False"`` — again not a sha, again non-empty.
    Worse than null: because the truthiness test is on the STRINGIFIED value, a

    mapping, a block scalar, a value continued on the next line, an anchor
    another key aliases, a nested key of the same name, the key quoted inside
    ANOTHER key's literal block. Each of those had the old scanner either write
    nothing or corrupt the spec, and every enumeration written for this (mine and
    both reviewers') missed shapes the next one caught.

    So this does not widen a pattern. It makes the trial edit, re-parses it with
    ``yaml.safe_load`` as an ORACLE, and keeps it only if the block still parses
    as a mapping, its top-level ``key`` is exactly ``value``, and **every other

    Candidates are ITERATED, not broken on at the first match. That is what fixes

    degrades it to ``{}`` because observation may, but a writer that concluded
    "no status here" from a block it could not read would report success for a
    spec it never touched.

    ``insert`` adds the key as the block's last line when the reader sees no such
    top-level key — what `verify.set_frontmatter_field` and
    `devcontract.reset_spec_status` need and `set_frontmatter_status` must never
    do. It is gated on the READER's view rather than on a scan miss, which is the
    other half of the same defect: a scan that missed a quoted key then appended
    a SECOND one, and the file ended up with two. The inserted line takes the

    A minimal in-place line replacement (not a YAML round-trip) so the spec's
    formatting, comments, and field order survive — only the status value
    changes, and the edit is verified by re-parsing before it lands (see
    `_edit_frontmatter_block`).

    That includes the file's LINE ENDINGS, every one of them: the read is
    ``read_bytes().decode`` and the write is ``write_bytes``, so a CRLF spec
    stays CRLF and a mixed-ending spec keeps each line's own terminator. Going
    through ``read_text``/``write_text`` instead relaid the whole file — CRLF in,
    LF out on POSIX, and every LF out as CRLF on Windows — which is the largest
    violation a writer contracted to "only the status value changes" can commit.

    The rewrite is also atomic (#379): the bytes go out through
    `platform_util.atomic_write_bytes`, which is byte-verbatim on the same terms
    as `write_bytes` and additionally leaves either the old file or the whole new
    one. That matters most here, where the layout is ``before + edited + after``
    — a truncating write that faults after the frontmatter has landed leaves
    intact frontmatter saying ``status: done`` over a decapitated body, a spec
    that lies and that the loop then commits. `devcontract._atomic_write_spec`
    reached the same conclusion on the same files, with fault injection: it cut a
    46-byte spec to 12.

    The write is CONFINED, and this is the canonical statement of the rule the
    FOUR writers of a spec's bytes share (`verify.set_frontmatter_field` and
    `devcontract._atomic_write_spec` restate it by reference; `runs._restore_rearmed_spec`
    — the re-arm transaction's UNDO — implements it so it can put back exactly what the
    other three published, and a spec they can write but it refuses is the transaction's
    write set going unhonoured):

    * A spec path under ``confine_root`` goes through
      `platform_util.atomic_write_bytes_confined`, which walks the components
      below that root ``O_NOFOLLOW`` and writes through the descriptor the walk
      produced. Refusing a link at the FINAL component was never enough (#593):
      `mkstemp(dir=...)` and `os.replace`'s destination still looked every
      DIRECTORY above the spec up by name, so a link planted at the artifacts
      folder landed both the temp and the published spec wherever it pointed —
      and the callers' own ``mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)`` accepts a
      symlinked directory, so a planted parent survives the setup step.
    * A spec path OUTSIDE ``confine_root`` keeps the plain no-follow write. An
      artifacts folder configured outside the checkout is real, supported
      configuration (`bmadconfig` resolves one; `verify.spec_within_roots` trusts
      it), and a confined writer cannot vouch for a tree it was not given — so
      refusing there would break working setups rather than close a hole.

    ``follow_symlinks=False`` on that second arm matches the name-replacing
    `atomic_replace` this writer's `devcontract` sibling always had. A spec path
    is handed to this writer from a session-driven scan, so honouring a link
    planted there would aim a host-side write wherever that session chose. The
    confined arm needs no such flag — it never follows anything.

    ``confine_root`` is a REQUIRED keyword: a caller that has not decided which
    checkout the spec belongs to is a pyright error rather than an unconfined
    write, which is how every call site of this and its two siblings was found.

    ``require_writable_target=True`` on both arms (#597): a spec is
    operator-editable, and a temp-and-replace write needs write permission on the
    PARENT DIRECTORY, never on the entry it replaces — so before this a spec an
    operator had marked ``0444`` was rewritten anyway and, where the mode was
    inherited, came back reading ``0444`` with nothing in the permission bits to
    record it. The kernel's `PermissionError` is what a bare ``write_bytes``
    raised, and it is what this raises again.

    Returns True when the file was rewritten. Returns False for **nothing to
    change** only: no file, no frontmatter block, no top-level `status` for
    `read_frontmatter` to see, or already at the target. Raises
    `FrontmatterWriteError` when the reader CAN see a status the edit cannot
    safely move — `False` never means "I failed".

    A trailing inline comment on the status line survives too, when the render
    can certify where the scalar ends (`_VALUE_COMMENT_RE`); a value it cannot
    read as a bare token drops the comment rather than guessing at one.

    ONE deliberate non-preservation remains, pinned in tests/test_frontmatter.py:
    the value's own quotes are dropped (`status: 'x'` -> `status: done`), because
    the standard fixture shape is quoted and callers read the result back
    unquoted.
