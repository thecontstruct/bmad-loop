"""Cross-run pre-answers for deferred-work decisions.

A sweep's triage can surface decisions only a human can make. An unattended
sweep (`--no-prompt`) skips them; an interactive sweep can be abandoned before
every prompt is answered. Either way the answer is otherwise lost: triage
re-derives the `decisions` partition from the open ledger on every run, and the
only record of an answer — the run-scoped `{run_dir}/decisions.json` — does not
carry across runs, so the next sweep re-surfaces (and re-skips) the same
decision.

This module is the durable carrier. A human answers missed decisions out of band
(`bmad-loop decisions`, or the TUI), the answer is recorded both as a ledger
`decision:` line and — for build/keep-open — in a project-level
`.bmad-loop/decisions.json` keyed by DW id, and the next sweep consumes it
instead of asking again (see SweepEngine._decisions_phase). `close` answers need
no store entry: they are applied to the ledger immediately (status -> done), so
the entry simply leaves the open set.

Layering note: this module sits above sweep.py (it reuses Decision/validate_triage
and the deterministic ledger helpers). sweep.py imports it lazily to avoid a cycle.
