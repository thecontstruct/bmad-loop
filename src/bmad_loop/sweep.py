"""Deferred-work sweep: triage the ledger, decide, execute bundles.

A sweep is its own run type. One LLM triage session classifies every open
deferred-work entry (verified against actual code — ledger statuses are
unreliable); the orchestrator validates the result deterministically, asks
the human about decision items (interactive runs only), then drives each
work bundle through the inherited dev -> review -> verify -> commit pipeline.
The orchestrator performs all ledger edits it can do deterministically and
gates on the ones it delegates (verify.verify_review_bundle).

    ONE schema for the two readers of a stored answer — `SweepEngine._decisions_phase`'s
    read loops and `decisions.pending_missed_decisions` — because they have to agree
    (DW-142): a value one accepted and the other rejected was an id that either got
    silently ignored by every sweep while this command counted it answered, or the
    reverse. The returned string is the `malformed` row's reason, so it names ids,
    fields and TYPE names only, never a stored answer's prose.

    The checks are exactly what the consumers assume, no more — because rejecting is
    not free: an answer refused here stops being seeded, and for `keep-open` that
    means it stops SUPPRESSING bundles, so a later cycle can bundle and build work
    the human explicitly asked to leave alone. A field is therefore screened only
    where a reader of THIS effect actually consumes it.

    `effect` must be a recognized `DECISION_EFFECTS` member because
    `_materialize_bundles` routes on it and an unrecognized one matches no lane — the
    answer counts as given while nothing acts on it. `key` and `label`, when present,
    must be strings for every effect: `_agreeing_option` reads both and runs on both
    lanes. `intent` and `bundle_name` are screened for `build` ONLY, the sole lane
    that reads them — a list `intent` used to reach `Bundle.intent` as its truthy
    Python repr and ship into a dev session (DW-141), while the same corrupt field on
    a keep-open answer is inert prose no reader touches. Fields no reader consumes
    (`resolution`, `answered_at`) are not validated for any effect.

    `close` is usable for the RUN store (`allow_close=True`) even though
    `record_pre_answer` never stores it: the interactive writer in
    `_decisions_phase` records `effect: "close"` for a decision answered `close`
    this run, so rejecting it would re-ask a decision the human already answered
    inside the same run. That justification does NOT transfer to the project store
    (DW-147): `apply_pre_answer` applies a `close` to the LEDGER and deliberately
    skips `record_pre_answer`, so no legitimate producer writes one there — a
    `close` in `.bmad-loop/decisions.json` is hand-seeded or corrupt, and it used
    to be counted answered by every reader while matching NO `_materialize_bundles`
    lane (which needs `build` or `keep-open`), leaving the id never built, never
    closed and never re-offered. Hence the store, not the reader, selects the gate:
    `allow_close` is keyword-only and has no default, so a future reader has to
    state which store it is reading rather than inherit the wrong answer silently.

    Rejecting is never a repair — the caller keeps the value and re-publishes it
    unchanged; see `_decisions_phase`'s `unusable` map and `load_pre_answers`."""

    became the truthy repr "['do', 'x']", which satisfied the
    `effect == "build" and not intent` gate, landed in `DecisionOption.intent`
    and rode into `Bundle.intent`, `intent.md` and a dev session — the DW-141
    harm, on the plan surface instead of the persisted-answer store. A malformed
    plan is REFUSED and re-driven instead, through the `errors` channel that
    already exists; there is no repair path and no new drop cause.

    The message names a POSITION, or the decision id when that id is itself a

    DW-157 a decision-level message can name the decision's own position too,

    `test_validate_triage_reports_one_error_when_a_name_fails_both_gates`). The
    dataclasses are constructed with `value or ""` at the end.

    `question` (DW-156), `recommendation` and `context`. Everything else off a
    triage plan — the decision, section and `dw_ids` identifiers,
    `already_resolved.evidence`, `blocked.blocker`, `skip.reason` — keeps its
    `str(...)` treatment deliberately.

    `key` and `question` joined the screened set under DW-156 for their LIVE
    unscreened sinks, including operator-facing and journaled consumers:
    `question` is printed by `DecisionPrompter.ask`, announced by `gates.notify`,
    written to the `decision-pending` journal record and listed
    by `bmad-loop decisions --list`; `key` is printed among the options there,
    persisted into the answer store and written to `decision-answered`. Both also
    reach `Bundle.decision_note` and so `intent.md`. That path already screened
    `key`: `_materialize_bundles` takes the option key only when `_agreeing_option`

    NOT type-checked (the DW-145/148 Never clause), so what validates and what is
    refused is unchanged by this helper. What is screened is what gets PRINTED. An
    object-valued `id` would otherwise interpolate its own stringified contents
    into every message its loop emits, and this module promises those carry a
    POSITION and the type name only, never the offending value's prose — these
    strings reach a journal.

    A `str` id (the empty string included, since the fallback is keyed on the TYPE
    and not on truthiness) keeps today's wording byte for byte: `shown` is the id
    itself and `label` is `f"{label_prefix} {raw}"`. A non-string one is named by
    its position in both.

    `shown` and `label` are separate values because the two display shapes are:
    `claim`'s `appears in both` prints the subject BARE, while the loops'
    `has no evidence` / `names no blocker` / `gives no reason` / `has no question`
    messages print it behind a section prefix. For a string id the two collapse to
    the strings each site emitted before.

    The two BARE-only callers — a bundle's `dw_ids` members (DW-178) and
    `validate_migration`'s `mapping[i].dw_id` (DW-180) — have no section-prefixed
    message at all, so they pass `label_prefix=""` and discard `label`. Sites that
    print the subject `repr`-QUOTED are not this helper's: `mapping invents unknown
    key {k!r}` and `mapping repeats key {k!r}` go through `_shown_value`. Those stay
    byte-identical for a STRING key only, which is the whole of the parity this
    module promises: the old spelling was `repr(str(raw))`, so a non-string SCALAR
    key that printed `'5'` or `'None'` now prints `5` or `None` unquoted. That is
    accepted — `_shown_value(str(raw))` would restore the quoting only by putting an
    object key's stringified prose back into the message, which is the leak.
    `validate_migration`'s `manifest says ..., ledger disagrees` needs neither
    helper: it is reachable only once `source` AND `target` are both non-`None`,
    which proves its key is a genuine manifest key and its id a genuine ledger id —
    both strings by construction.

    Status alone was the whole snapshot until #519, and that is what let a

    is both silent and unsafe. ``deferred-work-format.md`` calls removing it
    "the exact failure this field exists to prevent", and
    ``Engine._refuse_gated_story`` then dispatches the story the entry was
    holding back.

    ``gate_tokens`` unions :attr:`~bmad_loop.deferredwork.EntryGates.tokens`
    with ``malformed`` because the question is "did a token the entry declared
    survive", not "was it enforceable". A malformed ``gate: 3.2`` gates nothing,
    but it reads to anyone scanning the entry as a gate in force and ``validate``
    reports it (``deferred.hard-gate-unstructured``); dropping it retires that
    report silently, which is the same failure one level down.

    The counts ``EntryGates`` also carries — ``lines``, ``empty``, ``near_miss``
    — are deliberately NOT snapshotted. None of them names a story, so losing one
    cannot change which story is gated, and they are exactly what a legitimate

    The restart resets ``attempt`` to 0 for a fresh budget, and that reset is exactly
    what makes the next dispatch re-mint ``attempt == 1`` — an id byte-equal to the
    abandoned attempt's, since ``engine._session_task_id`` emits its discriminator only
    above zero. The artifact a shared id corrupts is ``tasks/<id>/escalation.json``: the
    sweep skill writes it, and two records carrying one id both name that one mutable
    file, so the abandoned cycle's escalation is the fresh session's too.
    ``resolve._gather_escalations`` now opens each distinct ``task_id`` once and
    de-duplicates entries by content, so it no longer reports the same aliased file
    twice. Both adapters also unlink cycle outputs in ``start_session``, which stops a
    healthy restart from inheriting stale contents — but cleanup still leaves the two
    historical records naming one mutable directory: a healthy restart erases the
    abandoned cycle's artifact, while a re-escalation replaces it for both records.
    Minting a fresh id is what preserves one artifact namespace per recorded cycle.

    Same pattern as ``runs.rearm_escalation``, DIFFERENT reason: #705's harm is
    ``_resumable_session`` verdict replay, which runs only on the dev/review phases and
    never reaches ``TRIAGE_RUNNING``/``TRIAGE_VERIFY``. ``cmd_resolve`` *can* reach a
    sweep task (``_escalate`` raises with ``PAUSE_ESCALATION`` and a story key, which
    the engine persists), and its own bump there is harmless: the re-arm leaves the task

        `_decisions_phase`'s tail publish: the window that loses the verdict opens
        the instant a latch is armed and closes only when the gate has reported.
        DW-219's trigger is the `_check_stop_request()` the withheld branch takes
        AHEAD of its `sweep-bundles-withheld` row; DW-218's is any crash in the

        interactive arm arms and then `continue`s into an iteration that blocks on
        `prompter.ask`, so a stop or crash at a LATER decision's prompt ends the
        process with the verdict still only in memory.

        Arming in-walk does not make the run-scoped flag stickier than the latch it
        mirrors — outside the two states `_release_ledger_doubt` refuses to clear,
        where it is stickier on purpose (see that helper's guard paragraphs).
        `_decisions_phase`'s commit gate and `_cycle`'s dispatch gate both read the
        mirror through `_ledger_unfit_to_publish()`, so a mirror that outlived a
        doubt the walk went on to disprove would withhold a commit and a dispatch
        that the local latch had already released. `_release_ledger_doubt` is the
        counterpart, called from the two sites that clear the local latch — and it
        clears only for an arm THIS process made, refusing while the close phase's
        latch is armed this cycle or while the mirror was inherited from a previous
        process.

        DW-218's own stated repro — `_prune_pre_answers` letting an `OSError`
        propagate out of the cycle — is no longer reachable, and the entry is kept
        for its CLASS rather than that path: DW-197 degrades that read to a latch
        and a journal row, and DW-217's `ledger-in-doubt` refusal returns ahead of
        the store write. A reader chasing the entry's repro would be hunting a path
        that no longer exists; the crash window this closes is the general one.

        Why this verdict is persisted where `_prune_ledger_unreadable` is not, so
        the two rationales cannot be read as contradicting each other. The prune
        latch is unpersisted because a resume of the same run meets the identical
        bytes at `_loop`'s own top-of-cycle read and ends the run there, so no
        resume can get far enough to read a persisted flag. That argument holds
        only for bytes NOBODY CAN DECODE. This verdict also arms on `OSError` /
        `ValueError` / `StateRootError` and on a write that half-landed — none of
        which say the bytes fail to decode. On that class the resume's re-read
        PASSES, `pending` filters the stored answer out (it is already in
        `answers`), the DW-167 re-apply walk drops the id because the half-write
        already flipped it to `done`, and `_decisions_phase` re-assigns `False`. So
        the resumed cycle sails past every in-memory arm and dispatches — the exact
        resume the prune argument says cannot happen.

        Only on the False->True EDGE, so the nine call sites (the close phase's
        degrade, the five arms inside the decision phase, that phase's tail
        publish, `_commit_ledger`'s ledger-family refusal arm since DW-244, and
        its ledger-family resolve-fault arm since DW-260) cost one `_save()`
        per edge rather than one per arm — an edge, not a run: `_release_ledger_doubt`
        writing False re-opens it, so a fault/success/fault sequence inside one walk
        saves here more than once. That helper owns the lifetime from here: it clears
        the mirror for an arm THIS process made, while an arm inherited across a
        resume or raised by the close phase stays until a human edits the ledger and
        starts a fresh `bmad-loop sweep`, which is a new run with fresh state.

        stickier deliberately.

        `_decisions_phase`'s local `ledger_in_doubt` is the LAST attempt's verdict,
        not the walk's: an effect that lands afterwards proves the ledger reads and
        writes again, so the walk clears it and the cycle dispatches. Mirroring at

        ablates against by name. So this is called from exactly the two sites that

        It does not reopen DW-218/219's window: the crash class those entries name
        is a process that dies BETWEEN an arm and the next successful land, and
        across that span the mirror is on disk. What clears is a doubt the walk
        itself went on to disprove.

        Guarded on `_close_ledger_in_doubt` because that latch is a DIFFERENT
        phase's verdict about a DIFFERENT write (DW-216): `_close_resolved` ran
        ahead of this walk, and a decision effect landing here proves the ledger
        reads — it does not make the close phase's half-write publishable. Bare,
        this would drop the close phase's doubt from `state.json` and hand the
        resume the dispatch the DW-218 crash row exists to refuse. The cycle-local
        latch itself is unchanged either way; only the mirror is at stake.

        Guarded on `_ledger_doubt_inherited` for the same reason across PROCESSES,
        and this one is the whole point of the entry rather than a corner of it. A
        walk may release only an arm it made ITSELF. Run 1 faults decision A's
        effect and dies before decision B is answered; the resume answers B, B's
        effect lands, and a bare release would drop A's verdict, open the gate and
        let the bundle commit publish A's half-write — which is verbatim the
        "`_decisions_phase` re-assigns False, so the half-recorded ledger reaches
        HEAD" defect, re-entered through the release instead of through the missing
        mirror. "The ledger reads and writes again" is a true statement about THIS

        """Publish a close whose ledger write landed but whose commit never ran,
        at `_loop`'s empty-open-set exit (DW-193).

        The RESUME-ONLY term is the CACHE, and it carries the whole
        recovery/fresh-sweep distinction with no extra state flag: `triage{suffix}
        .json` for THIS cycle exists only because a previous pass of this run
        already triaged it, so a fresh `bmad-loop sweep` over an empty-or-absent
        ledger returns here before any read and spawns no git at all — graded at the
        git seam by `test_a_fresh_nothing_open_sweep_spawns_no_git_at_the_no_open_exit`
        for THIS arm, the way `test_a_phase_that_wrote_nothing_spawns_no_git` grades
        it for the phase-local one. The CURRENT-CYCLE suffix is load-bearing for the same
        reason: under `--repeat`, cycle 1's finished `triage.json` must not
        authorize a publish at cycle 2's no-open exit, where the cycle that would
        have replayed it never ran.

        The cache is loaded the way `_ensure_triage`'s cache branch loads it —
        `_read_json` plus `validate_triage(cached, None)`, whose `None` skips the
        open-set equality re-check, which is exactly what a nothing-open resume
        needs since the ledger has moved since the plan was written. It is read
        DIRECTLY rather than through `_ensure_triage`: past that method's cache
        branch it dispatches a triage SESSION, and a nothing-open resume must never
        spend one.

        Second term: the SAME per-id evidence the phase arm uses — one read of the
        ledger through `_done_on_disk`, answering which named ids read `done` — over
        the cached plan's `already_resolved` ids AND, since DW-222, over its
        `decisions` ids. One rule at both sites — publish on positive per-id
        evidence of a landed write, never on the ledger merely being dirty — so
        everything that reader documents about what the probe does and does not
        prove applies verbatim here, including its empty-`ids` short-circuit.

        TWO PROBES combined with `or`, never one merged id list, and they are
        DIFFERENT views of the reader. The decision phase strands a close the same
        way the close phase does: `_apply_decision_effect` calls
        `deferredwork.record_decision(..., close_note=...)`, which flips the entry
        to `status: done <date>` on disk, and `_decisions_phase` publishes only at
        its own tail — so a crash between that write and that publish leaves a
        decision-phase close durable on disk and off HEAD, and when it retired the
        last open entry the resume reaches THIS exit with nothing else to run. The
        already-resolved term is `_resolved_write_pending`, the `all` view: the
        close phase closes its ids as ONE batch (`mark_done_many`), so a stranded
        batch write is every id `done`. The decision term is `_any_write_pending`,
        the `any` view (DW-249): decision closes land one effect at a time, so a
        plan with two decision ids where one is absent from the ledger — retired
        by a rival writer, or never closed at all — still carries a stranded close
        under the other, and an `all` over the pair answered False and never
        published it at this exit. Merging the two id lists into one `all` call
        would AND the terms the same way (a NARROWING of the arm that shipped);
        the `any` view makes an absent or unparseable id veto only itself. Both
        views short-circuit on empty `ids` before reading anything, the decision
        set is read ONCE, and the `or` still skips that read when the
        already-resolved term proves the write.

        THE DOUBT GATE sits above BOTH probes (DW-250), read through
        `_ledger_unfit_to_publish()` and reported through `_withhold_ledger_publish`
        with the union of both id lists in `dw_ids`. A failed decision effect can
        leave a decodable done flip without its audit line, a ledger-family refusal
        arms the same verdict (DW-244), and a crash preserves either across a
        resume; readability alone must not authorize publishing those bytes. Until
        DW-250 only the decision term read the verdict, so a resumed run holding
        persisted doubt still published the WHOLE file — the unaudited flip
        included — whenever its cached plan carried an already-resolved id that
        read `done` (the Codex P1 on #792 met the same hole from the other side:
        the `or` short-circuited past a decision-term guard), and a plan with only
        decision ids under doubt returned with no row at all. The gate is placed AFTER the cache is validated and the two id
        lists are known, and after the empty-plan short-circuit: an empty plan
        would never have published (both probes short-circuit), so there is
        nothing to decline and no row is owed — the same "only when a publish was
        about to happen" shape the three DW-246 sites have — and a fresh sweep
        returns even earlier, at the cache term, so its "no read, no git" property
        is untouched. The gate does not change the shared reader or add a phase
        gate; the phase arm's own gates are `_close_resolved`'s (DW-246).

        WHAT THE PROBE PROVES HERE is weaker than the rule's wording suggests, and
        reading it as a contradiction is the trap. This exit is reached only when
        the open set is EMPTY, so over a well-formed ledger every id still in the
        file already reads `done` — which makes the term close to a PRESENCE check
        at this one call site, for the decision ids and the already-resolved ids
        alike (and, under the `any` view, presence of ANY ONE decision id). That
        is pre-existing, not something the widening introduced: the
        already-resolved term has had exactly this property since DW-193, and it is
        tolerable for the reason `_resolved_write_pending` gives — the answer
        authorizes a COMMIT of the ledger, which is the right outcome for a durable
        close whoever wrote it. What the probe still refuses is the part that
        matters: `DWEntry.done` is deliberately not `not .open`, so an id the ledger
        does not carry and an id whose status the format cannot parse both prove
        nothing and authorize nothing, and an empty plan reaches no git at all.

        Faults DEGRADE and end on `_loop`'s own unchanged `return`. A cache that
        cannot be read or does not validate journals `sweep-triage-reload-failed`,
        the kind `_ensure_triage` already mints for exactly that; a probe fault
        journals `sweep-resolved-close-unavailable` with `dw_ids` + `error`, the row
        `_close_resolved`'s degrade arm already writes for the same read. No new
        journal kind is minted at either — reusing the two readers' own rows keeps
        the kind registry untouched. Neither publishes anything. A WITHHELD publish
        (DW-250) is the third non-publishing outcome and is not a fault: the gate
        returns before any read, on `sweep-ledger-commit-withheld`.

        No `sweep-resolved-closed` row and no phase emissions: this is a PUBLISHER,
        not a replay of `_close_resolved`. `pre_close_resolved`/`post_close_resolved`
        pairing stays inside `_cycle`, which is why the phase is not called from
        here even though it would reach the same commit.

        WHOSE DIRT CAN RIDE ALONG, the caveat the phase arm's comment states and
        that binds HARDER here. The boundary that holds is the PATHSPEC:
        `_commit_ledger` narrows both git calls to the ledger file, so an operator's
        in-flight edits anywhere ELSE in the enclosing repository stay with their
        owner (DW-183/DW-185). Inside the ledger there is no such boundary — the
        file is published WHOLE — so an out-of-band edit to it rides into the
        `chore(sweep):` commit beside whatever this arm was asked to publish. The
        phase arm has that property only while a stranded write is outstanding;
        this one keeps it FOREVER, because the probe is keyed on ids that stay
        `done` once published, so every later resume of the same cycle reaches this
        publisher again (`path_clean` no-ops it while the file matches HEAD, but an
        operator's note written months after the close is exactly what stops it
        matching). Accepted deliberately by the DW-193 decision, on the same terms
        as the phase arm: the alternative is a per-hunk publish this bookkeeping
        does not have, and a durable close left off HEAD is the worse loss.

        persisted story_key. Returns how many were recovered.

        The base Engine._loop opens with _finish_inflight for exactly this reason;
        the sweep loop used to recover a bundle only from inside _run_bundle, which
        a cycle reaches only after re-deriving the bundle's key from the *current*
        triage plan. A re-armed bundle therefore survived a resume solely because
        the cached triage.json reloaded and re-emitted the same bundle name — lose
        that cache and a fresh triage partitions the ids under new names, silently
        orphaning the human's resolution (#94).

        Runs before the ledger is read, so a bundle it closes leaves the open set
        and no fresh triage can re-bundle those ids (validate_triage rejects a plan
        whose open_ids disagree with the ledger). A recovered bundle that defers or
        escalates keeps its ids open. A dev-leg discard never closes them; an
        in-place post-acceptance defer reopens this run's close, while an isolated
        unit's close dies with its unmerged worktree. The existing failed_ids filter
        then drops the fresh plan's overlapping bundle.

        One refusal sits between the recovery and the dispatch (DW-243/252), in
        `_ensure_bundle_intent`: a regeneration the ledger cannot serve — a read
        that faults, an absent file, or a readable ledger lacking an entry for one
        of the task's ids — PAUSES the run at the story gate on that task, and the
        `RunPaused` propagates straight through this frame to `Engine._run_inner`.
        The pass does not continue: no later in-flight bundle is re-driven and no
        cycle (hence no fresh triage) runs beside the refused task, so nothing can
        overwrite its name or re-adopt its ids while it waits. The task stays
        PENDING with its name, ids and attempt intact, the run stays un-finished,
        and `bmad-loop resume` after the repair re-enters this pass, recovers the
        same task, regenerates and re-drives it. Every refusal raises; a `True`

        keep-open answer's audit line) on the next sweep.

        EVERY ledger-read fault degrades here rather than propagating: absence
        (DW-176), undecodable bytes (DW-182) and an `OSError` from the read itself
        (DW-197). The case for staying loud is that
        this read decides a store WRITE, so refusing to guess is right — but the
        refusal IS the refusal to guess. It keeps every answer and prunes nothing,
        so the choice is not "guess vs. crash", it is "keep the store and say so
        vs. crash the sweep". This is end-of-cycle bookkeeping, including when
        bundles were withheld or the run is decisions-only: a raise here crashes
        the cycle over cleanup, where refusal costs only consumed answers
        re-offered on the next sweep. Bytes nobody could decode are unknown open
        work for exactly the reason absence is, so they take the same journal row under a
        second fixed `reason` token rather than a kind of their own.

        The undecodable refusal is not only journaled, it is CARRIED: it sets
        `_prune_ledger_unreadable`, which `_loop` reads at the repeat boundary and
        which ends a repeating run there. Without the carry the degrade is a
        half-measure — the boundary `_commit_ledger`'s pathspec IS the ledger, so
        the very next thing a repeating run does is COMMIT the bytes this method
        just refused to read, and cycle N+1 gets no further than `_loop`'s own read
        of them regardless (which ENDS the run there since DW-197, where it used to
        crash — the carry is what keeps the corrupt bytes out of HEAD either way).
        Absence (DW-176) sets nothing, deliberately: a ledger that is gone ends the
        next cycle cleanly on `no-open` rather than stopping it at all.

        `OSError` used to propagate here, on the argument that it says nothing
        about what the ledger holds — but that was never a reason to CRASH over it
        (DW-197). Every word of the degrade above applies to it verbatim: this is
        still the last call of the cycle, the refusal still keeps every answer, and
        an EACCES/EIO here reported a fully completed cycle as crashed. It refuses
        under the same kind and a THIRD fixed token, `ledger-inaccessible`, kept
        distinct from `ledger-unreadable` because the operator repair differs
        (permissions or storage, versus editing the file) and `reason` and `error`
        are both dropped from a `bmad-loop diagnose` dump, so the token is the only
        thing that survives one. The triad reads cleanly: `ledger-absent` (not
        there), `ledger-unreadable` (there, undecodable), `ledger-inaccessible`
        (there, the OS refused). It CARRIES too, on its own latch, for the reason
        the undecodable arm carries — with the same asymmetry against absence.

        A FOURTH refusal (DW-217) sits below all three and is the only one taken
        with the ledger perfectly readable: this cycle already declared the ledger
        unfit to publish (`_ledger_unfit_to_publish`), so the open set derived from
        these bytes is not a KEEP list anybody should trust. It covers the decodable
        fault class the three reads above cannot see — a half-landed write that
        flipped a status without recording its line — where an id the aborted write
        retired would otherwise take the human's pre-answer with it, committed. It
        carries nothing: the latch it read is already `_loop`-bound.

        `_close_resolved` and `_decisions_phase` also catch `OSError` and
        `LedgerReadFault` around `mark_done_many` and `record_decision`, covering
        OS read, lock and write failures. The DW-167 re-apply gate catches its
        direct read too:
        a fault prevents repairing a stored close, leaving the entry open for a
        later cycle. Here the read protects the human's stored answers, so its
        refusal also carries to `_loop`; `_read_cycle_ledger` instead stops before
        starting work. `read_for_write` wraps OS metadata and text-read faults as
        `LedgerReadFault` (DW-279); pre-lock probes, lock and write failures
        remain raw `OSError`.

        """Retire the PROJECT-level pre-answer a just-dropped stale answer came
        from (DW-143). Part of the drop itself, not a later cleanup. `answer` is
        the value this run just dropped, and the store entry goes ONLY while it
        still equals it — see the provenance guard below.

        Why it exists: DW-124's quarantine is RUN-scoped by design, so it bounds
        the drop to one announcement per run and a NEW run re-evaluates from
        scratch. But the answer that feeds a stale drop lives in the project store,
        `pending_missed_decisions` filters out any id already usably answered
        there, and `_prune_pre_answers` retires an entry only once a later cycle
        bundles the id and closes it. While triage keeps re-asking the id as a
        DECISION instead, that never happens: every new run re-read the same stale
        answer, re-dropped it and re-notified, and no surface re-offered the id.
        Removing the entry at the drop breaks that loop from both ends — the next
        run reads no stale answer, and `bmad-loop decisions` offers the id again.

        Keep-open-only, deliberately. A dropped `build` answer (`no-intent`,
        `name-collision`) leaves its entry open to be re-asked with the stored
        answer still meaningful, where a dropped keep-open answer has no payload
        left beyond the option it named — there is nothing to preserve.

        Called AFTER `_quarantine`, which is the announce-then-persist order that
        method's docstring promises: the residual crash window (announced,
        quarantined, store not yet pruned) resumes into the DW-124 skip and the
        entry is pruned by the next run that re-drops it. The reverse order would
        leave a window in which a human's answer is already gone while the run has
        no record of having dropped it.

        Reaches the project store ONLY. `<run>/decisions.json` keeps the answer
        (the run-local audit trail is untouched by design) and so does whatever
        `decision:` line `_apply_decision_effect` landed — since DW-186 that call
        can report it wrote none, and this drop is unchanged either way. The journal
        row carries the id and the drop cause alone — no answer prose, no store
        path.

        Retires the entry ONLY while it still holds the value that was dropped.
        The dropped `answer` is this run's RUN-LOCAL copy, and `_decisions_phase`
        lets that copy win over the project store for the rest of the run — so a
        human who re-answers the id out of band while the run is paused
        (`pending_missed_decisions` screens against the store alone, never against
        a run's `decisions.json`) leaves a NEWER store entry this run has never
        evaluated. Keyed on the id alone, the removal deleted that replacement, and
        committed the deletion, on the strength of a stale copy the human had
        already superseded. `drop_pre_answer` compares before it deletes: a seeded
        copy round-trips through JSON unchanged and so equals the entry it came
        from, while a re-answer differs in at least `answered_at`, and an
        interactive in-run answer never equals a store entry at all. The surviving
        replacement is left for the NEXT run to evaluate from scratch, exactly as
        a fresh answer would be; this run stays on its own record."""

        the dedupe record belongs to `_run_bundle`, which is the only caller
        that knows whether the bundle went on to USE the deduped name.

        The terminal-task early return below is what makes a resume cheap: a
        bundle already finished this run is skipped rather than re-driven. It
        used to compare the KEY alone (DW-125), and the key is a pure function of
        `(name, cycle)` — so when a resume loses `<run>/triage.json`,
        `_ensure_triage` regenerates a plan whose names are re-authored freely,
        and a fresh bundle that happens to reuse a finished bundle's name was
        silently swallowed with its ids never run. `_materialize_bundles`'
        uniqueness pass cannot see this: it compares names against THIS cycle's
        list, never against persisted state.

        The bundle's identity is its `dw_ids`, so agreement is tested on those,
        as SET equality — a regenerated triage may emit the same ids in a
        different order, and treating that as a new bundle would re-run finished
        work on every cache-loss resume, a worse regression than the bug. A
        persisted EMPTY list agrees with anything: it is the pre-`dw_ids`
        `state.json` shape (`model.py` loads a missing key as `[]`), and reading
        it as divergence would re-run every bundle of every legacy paused run.

        On divergence the name gains the same bounded `-2` … `-9` suffix
        `_materialize_bundles` applies to a colliding stored name — deduping the
        NAME rather than the key alone is what keeps `_bundle_key`, the intent
        dirname and `_ensure_bundle_intent`'s key→name round-trip consistent.
        This is the third collision remedy in this file and must not be confused
        with the other two: `_materialize_bundles` DISCARDS a colliding stored
        `bundle_name` (it has `decision-<id>` beneath it) and SUFFIXES that
        fallback (which has nothing beneath it). Here a validated plan name
        collides with PERSISTED state, and suffixing is the only repair — there
        is no fallback name to reach for.

        was minted for, once `_run_bundle` adopts a DIFFERENT bundle's ids onto it
        (DW-162, DW-163, DW-165). The four ids are one behavior: on divergent
        adoption the task stops owning the superseded bundle's state, so the clears
        live together and this docstring is the record of what is deliberately
        absent from them.

        Every field cleared here NAMES or BUDGETS the superseded bundle:

        - ``bundle_closes_intended`` -- the previous bundle's intended ledger
          closes. ``_carry_isolated_ledger_writes`` and the engine's post-rollback
          replay predicate both key on it, so a stale list closes ids this task
          never ran.
        - ``spec_file`` -- the superseded bundle's amended contract.
          ``_generic_bundle_prompt`` selects the restore-review prompt naming it
          (paired with ``restore_patch``), and ``Engine._record_dev_spec`` is a
          no-op once set, so a survivor would also refuse the replacement bundle's
          own spec on escalation.
        - ``restore_patch`` -- the diff of the superseded bundle's attempt.
        - ``attempt`` + ``review_cycle`` + ``followup_reviews_spent`` -- reset the
          retry and review counters; clear the associated ``defer_reason`` and
          advance ``generation`` for fresh session ids. These operations follow
          ``runs._rearm_escalation_locked``. A sweep bundle runs the base engine's
          review loop, so a
          replacement inheriting an exhausted review budget would force-converge or
          defer on its first round. ``attempt`` and ``generation`` in particular are
          inseparable: zeroing ``attempt`` alone re-mints a byte-equal session id
          (see ``_rearm_generation``).

        ``resolved_redrive`` is deliberately NOT cleared (DW-165's recorded
        2026-09-07 decision): it records that a HUMAN resolved this task, which is
        a fact about the task, not a statement about which spec the task owns.
        Nor is any of the following, each for its own reason:

        - ``sessions`` -- an append-only audit trail; ``_rearm_generation``'s fresh
          id namespace is what keeps the replacement's records distinct.
        - ``bundle_file`` -- the single most bundle-naming field here, and the one
          exception: the caller OVERWRITES it two lines later with this bundle's
          freshly written ``intent.md``, so clearing it would be dead code. Nothing
          reads it in between.
        - ``isolated_ledger_carried`` / ``harvest_carry_commit_pending`` -- the
          ledger-carry replay latches (``Engine._replay_unlatched_ledger_carries``
          skips a task already latched, which WOULD strand the replacement
          bundle's own close). Safe because both are set only on legs that have
          already reached a TERMINAL phase -- the ``_defer`` leg (DEFERRED) and
          past a unit merge (DONE / AWAITING_OPERATOR) -- and ``_run_bundle``
          returns on a terminal task before ever reaching this branch.
        - ``commit_sha`` -- names a commit that really happened; a later commit
          overwrites it.
        - ``rearmed`` -- ``_recover_inflight_bundle`` already cleared it on the
          reset that got us here.
        - ``preserve_ref`` / ``preserve_partial`` -- a ref to a rolled-back
          worktree that still exists on disk; clearing the name would orphan it
          rather than release it.
        - the ``baseline_*`` pair and ``worktree_path`` / ``branch`` -- mount and
          rollback anchors owned by the reset, not by either bundle.
        - ``dispatched_spec_file`` / ``dispatched_spec_snapshot`` -- ``Sweep``
          overrides ``_dispatched_spec_for_attempt`` to ``None`` and
          ``_requires_dispatched_spec_snapshot`` to ``False``, so a sweep task never
          binds them and a clear would be unablatable dead code.

        These clears are DEFENSIVE. No reachable sequence was demonstrated that
        strands a task with a superseded ``spec_file`` / ``restore_patch``
        (DW-162, DW-165) -- but ``_warn_stranded_bundles`` concedes an in-flight
        survivor is possible at all, so the guard makes the hazard structurally
        impossible instead of argued unreachable.

        An EMPTY persisted ``task.dw_ids`` reaches here and takes the FULL reset:
        it satisfies the divergence gate, which is exactly the reading
        ``_run_bundle`` already takes of an empty list for id adoption (that task
        genuinely has no ids and must take the bundle's). Nothing it holds is
        exempt on account of having no ids.

        Why the rearm is gated on DIVERGENCE here rather than added to
        ``_recover_inflight_bundle``'s reset tail: that tail mirrors
        ``Engine._finish_inflight``'s restart arm, which deliberately KEEPS a plain
        crash-restart's budget -- zeroing it there would let a crash-looping run
        never exhaust ``limits.max_attempts``. The two siblings that do zero
        (``_ensure_migration``'s reset, the triage reset) each gate on
        ``Phase.ESCALATED``, i.e. "the human resumed deliberately"; ESCALATED is
        terminal and so never reaches ``_recover_inflight_bundle`` at all.
        Divergent adoption is this seam's equivalent gate. Do not widen the scope
        to the agreeing (or merely reordered) re-dispatch: that is the same bundle
        the task already attempted, and its budget, spec ownership and intended
        closes are rightfully its own.

        human-resolved escalation is protected through every reset (mirrors
        engine.py:1163-1169).

        Returns True when the persisted PROCEED receipt carried the bundle all
        the way through accepted sync, review, and commit — the caller is done.
        Returns False once the task has been reset to PENDING, leaving the caller
        to dispatch it. A bare DEV_VERIFY + spec_file shape is insufficient: the
        pre-action decision save has the same shape for rejected decisions.

        Deliberately narrower than the base _finish_inflight: no
        `_resumable_session` arm, so a bundle whose host died in the
        post-session window still restarts rather than replaying its recorded
        result. Lifting that is a resume-fidelity change of its own. The
        COMMITTING window IS recovered, though — same as the base engine's
        resume-commit arm (#115). The base's `_pending_salvage_session` replay
        (DW-278) is not mirrored either: a bundle whose review-timeout salvage
        latched `salvage_refile_pending` — at its handoff save, or at the
        refile's repair pause — restarts here like every other post-session
        window, so the restart arm below CLEARS the latch as the base restart
        arm does (#794 review). Left set, the abandoned product's latch would
        ride onto the replacement attempt and force `_review_and_commit` down
        the review path it exists to bypass for a latched replay. Mirroring the
        replay is the same resume-fidelity change as the `_resumable_session`
        arm and is deferred with it.

        The reset tail below deliberately does NOT zero `attempt` or re-arm the
        session-id generation: like the base restart arm it mirrors, a plain
        crash-restart keeps its budget, so zeroing here would let a crash-looping
        run never exhaust `limits.max_attempts`. The fresh budget belongs to the
        ADOPTION site instead — `_run_bundle`'s divergence branch, via
        `_reset_superseded_bundle_state`, which is reached only when the caller
        hands this task a different bundle's ids. Those superseded-state clears
        are defensive: no reachable sequence was demonstrated for DW-162 or
        DW-165; the adoption-site guard makes that hazard structurally impossible.

        # that drops one twin's `gate:` silently. Grading the collapse instead
        # cannot be made safe — a snapshot keyed by id describes a merged entry
        # that never existed, and each half hardened on its own opens the next
        # cross-product. So a human renumbers, which is the call

            #     `_decisions_phase` (`any_effect_landed`), and
            #     `_publish_stranded_close` — `_loop`'s empty-open-set recovery
            #     arm, which reads the SAME per-id reader as `pending`
            #     (`_done_on_disk`) over the CACHED triage plan and so gates on
            #     the same landed write. Two VIEWS of that one reader, combined

            #     `already_resolved` ids, as `pending` does, and `any` over its
            #     `decisions` ids — the decision phase strands a close the same
            #     way this one does, since `record_decision` flips the entry to
            #     `done` on disk and `_decisions_phase` publishes only at its
            #     tail, one effect at a time. Two calls and not one merged `all`
            #     list: a union would AND the terms and narrow the arm. Its
            #     extra term is the CACHE: `triage{suffix}.json` for the
            #     current cycle must already be on disk, which is true only on a
            #     resume, so a fresh sweep over a ledger with nothing open still
            #     reaches no git at all.
            #   * THREE gate on something that does NOT prove a write: `_loop`'s
            #     post-recovery publisher counts recovered tasks (which may defer
            #     without editing the ledger), `_loop`'s cycle-boundary publisher

            #     sits ABOVE the `no-progress` and `max-cycles` returns, so all
            #     THREE cycle exits share the one call and it no longer reads
            #     `progressed` (which a dropped answer could set without touching
            #     the ledger anyway) — and `_ensure_migration` gates on
            #     `if not errors:`, a verdict on the rewrite session rather than on
            #     bytes changing. The boundary publisher stays BELOW `_loop`'s
            #     ledger-fault / unfit-to-publish stops, which still return without
            #     publishing.
            # The RUN'S DOUBT (`_ledger_unfit_to_publish()`, the one reader of the
            # two cycle latches and the persisted DW-218/219 mirror) is a SECOND,
            # non-uniform gate laid over the nine, and which sites read it is the
            # other trap to read as uniform:
            #   * FOUR read it at the call site and journal
            #     `sweep-ledger-commit-withheld` instead of publishing: this site's
            #     TWO arms and `_loop`'s post-recovery publisher, the debt settle
            #     included (DW-246 — all three
            #     run on a resume AHEAD of `_cycle`'s dispatch gate, so a run that
            #     KNEW its ledger was unfit published the whole file, half-write
            #     included, before the gate was ever consulted), and
            #     `_publish_stranded_close` (DW-250 — the gate sits above BOTH of
            #     its probes, and its row alone carries `dw_ids`, the union of the
            #     cached plan's already-resolved and decision ids it declined to
            #     prove; before DW-250 only its decision term read the verdict, so
            #     a doubted resume still published on an already-resolved id).
            #   * `_decisions_phase`'s tail publish already gated on the same
            #     reader, silently: its withhold is part of the walk's own verdict
            #     and is reported by `sweep-bundles-withheld` and the repeat stop,
            #     so it writes no row of its own.
            #   * `_loop`'s boundary publisher needs no gate of its own: it sits
            #     BELOW the unfit-to-publish stop, which returns first.
            #   * `_loop` reads it TWICE more, ahead of publishers rather than at
            #     them: the in-flight recovery pass is withheld whole (a re-armed
            #     bundle's own `commit_story` is a whole-tree `git add -A`;
            #     `sweep-bundles-withheld`), and `_ensure_migration` is refused on
            #     the doubt's own `ledger-unreadable` stop before any rewrite
            #     session is spent — so its publisher never reads it itself.
            #   * Both store prunes are about a different file and never read it.
            # Reading is one direction; ARMING is the other, and since DW-244 it
            # IS uniform across the ledger family: every LEDGER-family site — the
            # migration publisher and `_publish_stranded_close` included, whether
            # or not it reads the doubt — arms the mirror on a refusal inside
            # `_commit_ledger`, while the store prunes neither read nor arm it.
            # A refusal at the boundary publisher, which sits BELOW the unfit
            # stop, is therefore honoured one cycle LATER: cycle N+1 withholds its
            # bundles and ends on the unfit stop, unless one of its own effects
            # lands and releases the arm.
            # A withheld publish is NOT a refusal: no target was probed and no git
            # was spawned, so it carries `reason="ledger-in-doubt"` (DW-217's token
            # for a ledger that READS but is unfit) rather than a fifth
            # `refuse_cause`.
            # Beneath all nine are TWO uniform floors, in this order:
            #   * the TARGET VALIDATION (DW-199/203/205), which asks whether the
            #     declared `family`'s file is still there and still readable before
            #     any git runs. It is what the per-site guards above cannot cover:
            #     each of them grades the phase's own WRITE, and the ledger can
            #     vanish or go undecodable AFTER that write — at which point
            #     `commit_paths` would have staged the absence as a DELETION.
            #     Every site declares its family; none derives one.
            #   * `_commit_ledger`'s `path_clean`, which makes any of them a no-op
            #     when the published file already matches HEAD.
            # The per-site guards are the early-outs that keep a phase which wrote
            # nothing from reaching git at all. What the two write-result guards
            # cannot see is a publish a PREVIOUS invocation landed and never
            # committed — a replay closes nothing — so those two sites persist
            # the debt ahead of the write (`_owe_ledger_commit`) and `_loop`
            # settles it at the top of a resume.
            #
            # ...and BOTH arms sit behind the run's ledger-doubt verdict, the
            # inherited mirror in particular (DW-218/219): this phase runs at the
            # top of every cycle, ahead of the dispatch gate that reads the same
            # verdict, and its commit is of the FILE — so a resume that inherited
            # a doubt over a half-landed decision effect would walk that flip into
            # HEAD here, under this message, before `_cycle` withholds a single
            # bundle over the same bytes. A write that lands THIS pass is not a
            # release either: `_release_ledger_doubt` refuses an inherited arm on
            # exactly that proof. Withheld, the debt latched above stays for the
            # bytes on disk, the `sweep-resolved-closed` row still says what was
            # written, and the run ends where the doubt ends it. Same rule the
            # decision phase's tail publish and `_publish_stranded_close` apply.
            #
            # the ledger file: `mark_done_many` above wrote the ledger
            # ...withheld on the run's doubt (DW-246): on a resume this arm runs
            # ahead of `_cycle`'s dispatch gate, so it must read the same verdict
            # that gate reads. The close itself LANDED and its row above stands;
            # only the publish is withheld. It reaches HEAD through the human's
            # own commit (the notice's clean-worktree precondition) or through a

        split out under DW-249) — the shared reader behind `_resolved_write_pending`
        (the `all` view) and `_any_write_pending` (the `any` view). `None` means the
        ledger is ABSENT (`read_for_write`'s own answer); an empty `ids` answers an
        empty set WITHOUT reading, so a caller naming nothing takes no read at all.

        WHAT IT PROVES, exactly: that these ids read `done` NOW. Not that a previous
        pass of the caller's phase is what wrote them, and not that the bytes are
        still those of that write. This read takes NO cross-process ledger lock,
        where `mark_done_many` above took one for its read-edit-write, so the same
        rival writers that lock names — a live run's harvest, the TUI decision
        modal, `sweep --archive` — can have closed these entries instead, or can
        edit the file between this read and the publish. That is tolerable because
        of what the answer is USED for: a commit of the ledger file, which is the
        right outcome for a durable close whoever wrote it, and which
        `_commit_ledger` re-validates and no-ops on its own. It would NOT be
        tolerable for a claim about this run's work, which is exactly why
        `_close_resolved` writes no `sweep-resolved-closed` row on its `pending`
        arm and still returns `len(closed)`.

        POSITIVE PROOF, per id. `[]` back from a non-empty `ids` is ambiguous:
        `mark_done_many` skips both already-done ids AND ids the ledger holds no
        entry for. So an id counts here only when it parses to :attr:`DWEntry.done`
        — an id the ledger does not carry, or one carrying a status the format does
        not understand, is simply not in the answer, proves nothing and must not
        authorize a commit under either view. `.done`, never `not .open`, for the
        reason that property documents.

        `read_for_write`, not `read_for_observation`: this gates a PUBLISH, so its
        `None`/`LedgerReadError`/`OSError` answers belong in the caller's existing
        degrade arm rather than collapsing to an empty text that would read as "no
        entry is done" — the same answer a healthy ledger of open entries gives.
        Whether the file is actually dirty stays `_commit_ledger`'s `path_clean`
        question; this method spawns no git and asks no second one.

        detach a plain-shell client, switch a tmux client back to its origin. A
        plain foreground sweep (nobody attached, no return target) is untouched.

        We then go unattended for the rest of the run: a later --repeat cycle's
        input() would otherwise block forever in a window no one is viewing. New
        decisions defer via the unattended path instead, recorded for
        `bmad-loop decisions` or the next attended sweep.

        The trigger for that is "nobody can be relied on to answer here any
        more", NOT "the hand-back succeeded" — the two come apart on a failed
        return, in opposite directions. A *refused* switch is evidence the
        client is still in this window with a human in front of it (ATTENDED:
        keep prompting, which is the whole point of #227). Everything else
        reports only that no hand-back was verified — a detach that found
        nothing attached, an effect the backend cannot observe, no detach verb
        at all, or a switch the backend cannot vouch for (a timed-out verb, an
        unreadable client count, nothing attached to move) — and under that
        uncertainty going unattended is the outcome that does not strand a
        --repeat cycle on input(); the decisions it defers stay reachable via
        `bmad-loop decisions`. The `sweep-return-no-client` record keeps its
        name across that widening: it has always meant "no hand-back verified",
        which is what an unvouched switch reports too. Only a real return is
        announced: UNREACHABLE prints nothing, since there may be no one to
        read it.

        `every_effect_landed` says only what the printed line may CLAIM, never
        whether to hand back: the trigger above is unchanged, so a walk in which
        every effect faulted still detaches and still goes unattended. It is
        REQUIRED and keyword-only — there is exactly one caller, and a default
        would make the optimistic claim the thing a new caller inherits by
        forgetting. Sticky over the whole walk, unlike the flag that gates the
        phase's commit: a PARTIAL miss is still a miss to the human, and the line
        says "not every decision" rather than claiming a total one either way. The
        answers themselves are on disk in `<run>/decisions.json`, which the next
        cycle reloads, so what is short is the ledger alone. `bmad-loop decisions`
        reconstructs unanswered questions from triage files and the project-level
        pre-answer store; it does not read these run-local answers.

        THREE states. Both arms of `_decisions_phase` call this (the interactive
        arm since DW-281), but only the DW-167 replay walk can be refused into the
        third by design: it passes `require_open=True`, so beside "no ledger file"
        and "no entry carries this id" it can also be refused for an entry that is
        present and no longer open — a rival writer closed it between the walk's
        gate and its write, which means the close being repaired is already
        recorded. That is not a missing entry and must not be reported as one:
        the operator would go hunting a vanished entry that is sitting in the
        ledger, done. The interactive arm passes no `require_open`, so it reaches
        the third sentence only as a race — an entry added and closed between
        `record_decision`'s refusal and this probe — which is prose on a row
        nothing acts on, not a state the refusal saw.

        A fresh best-effort read, taken only to write the sentence. The OBSERVATION
        arm (DW-146) is the right one precisely because nothing is written from it
        and it never raises — a ledger that has gone unreadable since the refusal
        answers the empty text, which falls through to "no entry carries this id",
        the same sentence the pre-DW-167 code gave. Absence is the reader's own
        `(None, None)` answer, not an `is_file()` pre-gate (DW-265): that gate
        suppresses every OS error on Python 3.14 and answers False, so a refused
        ledger was reported as GONE there — a sentence that tells the operator
        every `decision:` line already written went with it, when the file is
        sitting in place, unreadable. The reader is the presence-aware
        `observe_ledger`, not `read_for_observation`, for the mirror-image reason
        (PR #794 review): the text-only reader answers the same `""` for a
        present 0-byte ledger as for a missing one, so testing the text's
        truthiness called a ledger that EXISTS and holds no entry gone. `None`
        is absence; `""` is a present, empty ledger, and falls through to the
        missing-entry sentence like any other text without this id.

        `.done`, never `not .open` — the derivation `DWEntry.done`'s docstring
        exists to refuse. Two states of the entry fall through to the
        missing-entry sentence rather than claiming a close that did not happen.
        An entry whose status the format cannot read (`status: opne`, or no
        status line) is NEITHER open nor done: `require_open` refuses it, and
        reporting it as "no longer open" would tell an operator the entry was
        closed when what actually happened is that its status line is broken. An
        entry this probe finds OPEN was reopened or replaced between the refusal
        and the read, which is a race, not a state the refusal saw. Both take the
        sentence this row carried before the third state existed — the
        conservative direction. Nothing acts on the row either way; it is prose
        for an operator, not a control decision.

        FIRST match wins, agreeing with `_find_entry` — and so with the entry
        `record_decision` actually refused on — because a duplicated id would
        otherwise let this sentence describe a different entry than the write

        was written — no ledger file at all, and no entry carrying this `dw_id` —
        and True only when it wrote one. Discarded, those two states are
        indistinguishable from a successful write at the call site, which then
        counts a closure and announces a `post_decision` for an entry the ledger
        never received.

        What False does NOT say is that the ledger was readable: the missing-file
        arm answers before any read. So the caller treats it as a non-write and
        nothing more — see `_decisions_phase`, which leaves `ledger_in_doubt`
        untouched on it for exactly that reason.

        `require_open` adds a THIRD non-write state, and only for the one caller

        matches HEAD.

        The rule is NAME THE FILE YOU PUBLISHED. `path` is the file the caller
        just wrote, and everything else follows from it: it is resolved, both git
        calls run in the resolved parent, and both are pathspec'd to the resolved
        basename. Nothing is derived from a role ("the project owns sweep
        bookkeeping") — the two families name different files because they write
        different files:

        * the seven ledger PUBLISHERS pass `self.workspace.paths.deferred_work`.
          The ledger hangs off `implementation_artifacts`, which
          `bmadconfig._resolve` accepts as any absolute path and
          `ProjectPaths.rebased` leaves unmoved when it sits outside the project
          — so it may be under the project, inside a disjoint `repo_root`, or in
          no repository at all, and git resolves the enclosing repository in all
          three. The WORKSPACE's copy, never `self.paths.deferred_work`, which is
          a different file in a different tree under worktree isolation.
        * the two pre-answer PRUNES pass `decisions.store_path(project)`. The
          pre-answer store is a bare join off the project root
          (`decisions.STORE_REL`) that no config knob can move, and the run dir is
          the anchor no workspace swap relocates.

        `self.workspace.root` is refused at every site. Where `repo_root` names a
        tree DISJOINT from the project it is the separate CODE repo, so a
        workspace-rooted commit interrogated a tree the write never touched
        (DW-160 for the prunes, DW-175 for the publishers): the clean check
        passed, nothing was committed, and the worktree carrying the edit stayed
        dirty ahead of this cycle's bundles. A hardcoded project root fails the
        mirror-image way for the publishers, which is why they do not use one.

        RESOLVED, following symlinks — and that rationale belongs to the LEDGER
        publishers alone (DW-188). Their writer is `platform_util
        .atomic_write_text`, whose default `follow_symlinks=True` resolves the
        target, so a ledger symlinked into the project has its TARGET rewritten.
        Against the lexical parent the two disagreed: the clean check interrogated
        the link's own directory while the bytes landed in the target's
        repository, which then received no commit at all. Resolving here is what
        makes the check, the commit and that write name one file, so
        `follow_symlinks=False` semantics would be exactly wrong for them —
        agreement with the writer is the property, not link-hardening.

        The two PRUNES are a different case and the resolve is not doing that job
        for them. Their writer is `decisions._write_store` via
        `atomic_write_text_confined`, which takes the OPPOSITE symlink policy:
        `follow_symlinks=False` refuses to write through a link planted at the
        store's own name, and a lexical parent walk refuses a redirected directory
        above it. So a store reached through a link is a shape that writer REFUSES
        rather than one it follows, and the resolve here can only ever agree with
        the plain path it did write. It stays uniform because a per-family
        spelling would claim a distinction the callers cannot act on — not because
        the two writers agree about links. Nothing here should be read as a
        promise that a symlinked pre-answer store works; its own writer says it
        does not.

        Both git calls see ONE scope: `verify.path_clean` checks the resolved
        basename and `verify.commit_paths` commits that same single path. That is
        what bounds the blast radius to the published file (DW-183/DW-185) — an
        operator's unrelated in-flight edits in the enclosing repository stay
        dirty rather than riding into a `chore(sweep):` commit — and what
        quarantines a withheld ledger from a LATER commit in the same cycle
        (DW-187): a prune commits the pre-answer store alone, so the undecodable
        bytes the decision phase refused to publish are still unpublished.
        `worktree_clean`'s `:(exclude)policy.toml` wart is gone with it: a single
        pathspec naming one published file cannot reach `policy.toml`.

        `commit_paths` rather than a narrow twin of `commit_story`: it already
        commits an exact path list, and it is stronger than a hand-rolled pair —
        it forces `:(literal)` pathspecs (an `implementation_artifacts` carrying a
        `[`, `*` or `?` reaches here verbatim from the operator's config, where a
        bare operand is a wildmatch glob), keeps a missing-but-TRACKED path as a
        deletion to stage, wraps its own root resolve in `GitError`, and answers
        `None` for "these paths held no change". `_commit_ledger` already knows
        that from `path_clean`, so a `None` here has TWO causes and not one: the
        pathspec went clean between the two calls, or the single operand survived
        neither the working tree nor the index (`commit_paths`' `if not rels:`
        arm, which drops a path git has never seen so one optional operand cannot
        hard-fail a whole commit) — a ledger deleted and left untracked after the
        check reported it dirty. Both mean nothing was published, which is what
        the row below announces.

        `path_clean` still runs FIRST, and is load-bearing rather than an
        optimization: `commit_paths` opens with `git add`, so without the check an
        already-clean publish would stage and re-interrogate a file it had nothing
        to say about — reaching git, and the index, for a non-event. Idempotent
        replays make that the ordinary case, not the rare one: a resumed cycle
        re-closing ids already `done` reproduces the committed bytes exactly.

        A `verify.GitError` from a tree git cannot INTERROGATE degrades to a
        journal row naming the resolved directory and the error, and under this
        rule that degrade is REQUIRED rather than a kindness. `cli`'s sweep
        precondition only requires `paths.repo_root` to be a git repository, so
        neither the project nor a freestanding artifacts directory need be one,
        and `git status` there answers `fatal: not a git repository`. Letting
        that raise through would abort the whole sweep over a destination that
        will answer the same way on every cycle — strictly worse than the missed
        commit it replaces. `decisions.apply_pre_answer` degrades on `GitError`
        for the store ("best effort, so a non-git or dirty tree never blocks the
        on-disk record") and this keeps them agreeing.

        A `GitError` from a commit that was ATTEMPTED is a different fault, and
        for the LEDGER family it propagates. `path_clean` runs first, so by the
        time `commit_paths` raises, git has already answered for this tree: the
        destination is a repository, the ledger is dirty in it, and the commit
        itself failed — a hook refused it, the index could not be written, the
        disk filled. That is not a destination that cannot be published to; it is
        a publication that failed, and the five ledger publishers raised on it
        before they were re-rooted (DW-175) — "their raise is the pre-existing
        contract, and nothing here should quiet a commit failure nobody asked to
        re-root", which the re-rooting then quieted by accident of sharing one
        handler with the store. Restored, because the degrade had a hazard behind
        it and not just a doctrine: the cycle's bundles run next, against a
        baseline this commit was meant to clean, and a dirty ledger there is
        swept into a story commit by `commit_story`'s `add -A` or discarded by a
        failed bundle's rollback — closures and `decision:` lines already
        journalled as landed. The STORE family keeps degrading on an attempted
        commit too, as it did before this PR (DW-160): its two prunes are the
        cycle's last call and a materialize-time drop, the on-disk record is what
        matters for a pre-answer, and re-dropping later is cheap. Observation may
        degrade, repair writes must raise (AGENTS.md); the ledger commit is the
        publication step of a repair, and the store commit is bookkeeping.

        The RESOLVE degrades to the same row for the not-a-repository reason, but
        from an arm of its OWN (DW-260): `path.resolve()` can raise `OSError` (a
        broken link chain, a permission-denied component) or `RuntimeError` (a
        symlink loop), and that pair is caught around the resolve alone, while
        the arm around `unpublishable_target`/`path_clean`/`commit_paths` catches
        `verify.GitError` alone. The split is by SITE, not by class, because the
        two faults say different things: a resolve that fails is the ledger's own
        path refusing to be walked — the readability fact `_cycle`'s dispatch
        gate withholds on — so the resolve arm ARMS the run's doubt for the
        ledger family exactly as the refusal arm below does, where a git fault
        after a successful resolve says nothing about readability and arms
        nothing. Narrowing the git arm loses no fault: `_run_git` translates
        spawn, timeout and decode faults into the `GitError` taxonomy,
        `verify.commit_paths` wraps its own resolves and `lstat` probes the same
        way, and `unpublishable_target` returns a token rather than raising.
        `verify.last_commit_for` guards its own resolve against the same pair.
        Best effort applies to Git interrogation and resolution only: journal
        I/O failures propagate, as they do for other journal writes, and so does
        either arming arm's `state.json` write (`_record_ledger_doubt()` →
        `_save()`, DW-244/DW-260) — a repair write must raise, the doctrine every
        other arming site follows.

        `path` is a REQUIRED keyword argument with no default, replacing the old
        `root=None` arm and its runtime raise. That is strictly louder, not
        laxer: a caller that forgets to name the file it dirtied now fails at call
        time and under pyright, before any run, instead of on whichever branch
        first reached the raise.

        `family` is REQUIRED and keyword-only for exactly that reason, and it is
        DECLARED rather than derived (DW-199/203/205). Before it, this method
        published whatever `path` named without ever asking whether that file was
        still there or still readable, and `verify.commit_paths` deliberately keeps
        a missing-but-TRACKED path as a DELETION to stage — so a ledger removed
        after the phase wrote it was committed as a deletion under a
        `chore(sweep):` message, and a resume whose ledger held undecodable bytes
        published them and only then raised on them. `verify.unpublishable_target` is the
        guard, and it runs between the resolve and `path_clean`: after, because git
        is asked about the RESOLVED target (DW-188) and those are the bytes that
        would be published; before, because a refused publish must spawn no git at
        all — the same property the per-site guards buy. The two families need
        different validation (the seven ledger publishers read through
        `deferredwork.read_for_write`, the two prunes probe the type directly —
        though BOTH families require a REGULAR FILE and both name
        `target-not-a-file` when they do not get one, since DW-238), and
        the family is a caller's declaration because deriving it from the path
        would be precisely the "chosen by role" test the rule above refuses; a
        required keyword-only argument also makes a NEW call site fail under
        pyright rather than silently inherit a validation it does not want.

        A refusal journals `sweep-ledger-commit-refused` and returns, exactly as
        the other two no-op arms do — never a raise, because the read this guard
        takes is bookkeeping and not the sweep's own read. `refuse_cause` is one of
        FOUR fixed tokens (`target-absent`; `target-undecodable`, the ledger's own
        decode fault; `target-unreadable`, a probe that raised;
        `target-not-a-file` — EITHER family's target replaced by a directory (or,
        for the store, a link to one), whose literal pathspec `git add` would
        stage recursively; a FIFO or socket at the name takes the same token) and is minted for
        the reason `stop_cause` (DW-201), `drop_cause` and `regen_cause` were: the
        natural spelling is `reason`, which sits in
        `diagnostics._JOURNAL_DROP_FIELDS` and renders as a presence boolean, so a
        scrubbed dump could not tell the causes apart. The decode or OS fault
        rides in `error` beside it, which is dropped, and `file` carries the same
        lexical basename the sibling rows do. What this guard does NOT do is
        rescue the run: `_loop`'s own ledger read still refuses the same
        undecodable bytes right after the refusal and ends the run there (it raised
        until DW-197 degraded it; either way the cycle does not proceed), which is
        pre-existing behavior. What is gone is the publish that used to precede
        it. A LEDGER-family refusal also ARMS the run's doubt through
        `_record_ledger_doubt()` after its row (DW-244): the refusal says the
        ledger the run wrote cannot be published, which is the very fact
        `_cycle`'s dispatch gate withholds on — without the arm a refusal after a
        landed decision effect left the gate clear and the cycle's bundles reached
        `_write_intent`'s bare `read_for_write` on the same ledger. A store
        refusal says nothing about the ledger and arms nothing. The resolve arm
        above ARMS on the same terms and for the same fact (DW-260): a ledger
        whose `path.resolve()` raises is one whose component `read_for_write`'s
        `stat` walks too, so a bundle dispatched behind the degrade crashed in
        `_write_intent` exactly as it did behind a refusal. The git arm — a
        `GitError` after a successful resolve — does NOT arm: git declining to
        publish a file it could reach is bookkeeping, not evidence about the
        file. Both arming arms are ledger-family only.

        The guard NARROWS a window it does not close, and the residual is worth
        naming the way `_prune_dropped_pre_answer` names its own: a TRACKED target
        removed between `unpublishable_target`'s probe and `commit_paths`' `git add` is
        still staged as a deletion. Closing it would mean changing
        `verify.commit_paths`, whose missing-but-tracked deletion contract other
        callers rely on, so it stays out of bounds here — and the residual is a
        genuine race (a file removed inside a few milliseconds by something that is
        not this sweep), where the shapes this guard exists for are steady states
        the publisher walked into deliberately.

        Both no-op outcomes journal `sweep-ledger-commit-clean` (DW-191).
        `path_clean` also answers True for an ignored path, so a ledger under a
        gitignored `implementation_artifacts` was previously skipped with no row
        at all. The shared row states only that nothing was published; no extra
        git call distinguishes ignored, unchanged or disappeared operands.
        Appends stay outside the guarded Git operations so a journal write fault
        cannot be misreported as a publication failure.

        `file` is the LEXICAL basename (`path.name`), never `target.name`, and
        that distinction is what makes it declarable (DW-192). The degrade row's
        other identifying field is `repo`, which — like `message` and `error`
        beside it — sits in `diagnostics._JOURNAL_DROP_FIELDS`, so a scrubbed dump
        retained nothing saying WHICH of the two published files went
        uncommitted. `file` is declared benign in
        `tests/test_portability_guard.py` and survives the scrub verbatim, and it
        can only be declared benign because every caller passes a code constant —
        `deferred-work.md` (`ProjectPaths.deferred_work`) or `decisions.json`
        (`decisions.STORE_REL`) — so the lexical tail is invariant by
        construction. The RESOLVED tail is not: the DW-188 resolve above follows
        a symlink to a target the OPERATOR named, so `target.name` can be
        arbitrary operator text of exactly the identifier shape `scrub_json`
        ships verbatim, and a benign row for it would be pre-approving that text.
        Bound beside `root` and before either `try` for the same reason `root` is,
        so the degrade row still names the file when the resolve is what failed.
        `repo` still carries the resolved directory for anyone reading the raw
        journal."""
        # `root` is re-bound off the resolved target below because the resolve
        # that derives it can itself fail; until it succeeds the only directory

        One place owns the read-and-degrade, so the screen in
        `_materialize_bundles` below reads as a screen rather than as I/O
        handling.

        REPAIR/WRITE (DW-146), never `read_for_observation`, and this is the
        decision that can be got backwards: the set does not DESCRIBE the ledger
        for a reader, it AUTHORIZES spending a dev session on a stored `build`
        answer. The observation arm answers `("", fault)` on both of its fault
        classes, and `open_ids("")` is empty — which under that screen reads as
        "no id is open" and would drop every adopted build answer in the cycle at
        once. The repair arm keeps absence (`None`) and undecodable bytes
        (`LedgerReadError`) distinguishable from a genuinely empty ledger, which
        is what lets the degrade keep every answer instead.

        `None` on all three fault classes, each under its own FIXED `reason`
        token — the triad `_prune_pre_answers` established: `ledger-absent` (not
        there), `ledger-unreadable` (there, undecodable), `ledger-inaccessible`
        (there, the OS refused). The raw journal distinguishes the repairs;
        `bmad-loop diagnose` reduces both `reason` and `error` to presence flags,
        so these tokens do not survive that export. Absence carries no `error`:
        there is no fault text, only the fact.

        A FOURTH refusal, `ledger-in-doubt`, mirrors the one DW-217 gave
        `_prune_pre_answers` and is the only one of the four taken with the ledger
        PERFECTLY READABLE. It covers the decodable fault class the three reads
        cannot see — a `record_decision` or `mark_done_many` that flipped a
        `status:` and then failed before writing its line — where the bytes read
        back fine and an id the aborted write retired reads as not-open. Here that
        would discard a human's recorded `build` answer, notify, and quarantine the
        id in PERSISTED run state for the rest of the run, so a resume taken after
        the operator repairs the ledger still skips it: strictly worse than the
        prune's consequence, off the same unfit bytes. Like its sibling it sits
        BELOW the read arms — they own the classes they observe, each with its own
        token — and it carries nothing, because the latch it reads is already
        `_loop`-bound.

        None of the four sets a repeat-boundary carry of its own, unlike
        `_prune_pre_answers`' two raising arms. If the cycle reaches that method,
        its fresh read owns the carry. This helper only guarantees degradation
        during materialization: a later `_write_intent` read can still raise
        before pruning runs.

        Arms NO ledger doubt, unlike the DW-167 re-apply gate whose read shape
        this otherwise copies verbatim. Doubt withholds every bundle in the
        cycle, far beyond the one screen this refusal is entitled to degrade —
        and the degrade here is already the conservative direction: a refused
        read screens NOTHING, so every answer keeps the disposition it had.
        Writes nothing — not the ledger, not `<run>/decisions.json`, not the
        project store — and spawns no git.

        """This cycle's bundles, and whether ANY recorded answer was dropped by one
        of the five drop lanes below — `_cycle`'s progress signal.

        Every drop is progress for the same reason (DW-123, widened to the build
        lanes by DW-135): it quarantines the id in `state.sweep_dropped_decisions`,
        so the id stops being bound to a stored answer nothing can act on and a
        later cycle's fresh triage is free to address it. The signal stays finite
        because that same list bounds each id to ONE drop per run — persisted, so
        the bound holds across a pause/resume too (DW-124) — and a given id can
        raise it at most once however many repeat cycles run.

        `effect_unlanded` is `_decisions_phase`'s per-id verdict (DW-200): the ids
        whose `build` answer this run recorded while `record_decision` reported
        writing no `decision:` line, so the ledger holds no entry to build for. It
        is REQUIRED and keyword-only for the reason
        `_return_after_decisions.every_effect_landed` is required — an empty default
        is the optimistic claim, and a new caller would inherit it by forgetting.

        The lane checks the UNION of that argument and
        `state.sweep_unlanded_decisions`, which the phase persists at the moment it
        observes the non-write. The argument alone covers only the frame that
        answered the decision; the persisted half covers the interval between the
        non-write and this drop, in which a stop-and-resume reloads a stored answer
        still saying `build` and re-enters here with an empty argument. Announcing
        the drop clears the id from that list in the same `_save()` that quarantines
        it in `sweep_dropped_decisions`, so an id never sits in both and the verdict
        never becomes a second announcement gate. It is cleared by the drop it
        PRODUCES and by nothing else: an id this lane is not reached for — a later
        cycle's triage stopped raising the decision, or the quarantine above already
        skipped it — keeps its verdict until the run ends, which costs a list entry
        and mints nothing.

        The FIFTH lane (DW-214) answers what `effect_unlanded` structurally cannot.
        That verdict is populated at exactly one site — the interactive
        `if not recorded:` arm — so it speaks only for an answer THIS run recorded
        at a prompt, and says nothing about one adopted from the project store or
        reloaded on a resume. `_ensure_triage`'s cache branch revalidates with
        `expected_open_ids=None`, so a resumed cycle can legally raise a decision
        for an id the ledger no longer holds open, adopt its stored `build` answer
        and spend a whole dev session briefed off a `_write_intent` read that finds
        no entry. So before a stored answer mints a bundle, the ledger's LIVE open
        set is read (`_live_open_ids`) and an id it no longer holds open is dropped
        down this same DW-200 lane — one row, one notify, the same quarantine.

        Lane ORDER is load-bearing in one direction. `effect_unlanded` names a
        NON-WRITE this run observed; the screen names a ledger FACT read just now.
        Where both hold, the older and more specific verdict is what the operator
        should be told, so the screen sits BELOW it and above the `no-intent` lane.

        The read is taken LAZILY and at most ONCE per call — the two locals below
        `bundles` are that cache and its latch — so a cycle with no adopted `build`
        answer reaching the screen takes no read at all, and two candidates share
        one read (and one refusal row, since the fault is cached with it).

        The same screen covers the PLAN's bundles too (DW-252), in the final keep
        loop. The cache branch's `expected_open_ids=None` revalidation admits a
        cached bundle naming an id a rival writer has since retired just as it
        admits a stale decision, and the keep loop screened those bundles only
        against `failed_ids | keep_open_ids` — so a resumed cycle spent a dev
        session on a bundle whose intent document could not find one of its
        entries. A bundle whose ids are not ALL open is dropped WHOLE (the triage
        intent prose was authored for the whole id set, and the adjacent
        `failed-or-escalated-earlier` lane already drops whole bundles on partial
        overlap) under `sweep-bundle-skipped` `reason="entry-not-open"`, naming the
        ids that are not open. It sits AFTER that overlap check so the older rows
        keep precedence, shares the one lazy read and latch above (a refused read
        screens nothing here either), and is a SKIP rather than a decision drop:
        no `drop_cause`, no quarantine, and `answer_dropped` untouched — there is
        no stored answer to release. A cycle whose only bundles were skipped this
        way therefore reports NO progress, so a `--repeat` run stops on
        `no-progress` there rather than re-triaging, and the skipped bundle's
        still-open ids wait for the next `bmad-loop sweep`: the skip deliberately
        errs toward stopping rather than being counted as progress.

        Bundle-close mutators (DW-280) and the terminal post-merge harvested
        append (DW-286) share ``sweep-bundle-close-refused``, the RESUME route,
        and a story-gate pause. The operation argument keeps both the transient
        notice and durable pause reason truthful while ``site`` remains the
        machine-readable discriminator.

        `fault` is the mutator's own exception, not its text, so the row keeps
        the classification `LedgerReadFault` (DW-279) exists to carry: an OS
        metadata/text-read refusal (`EACCES`, `EIO`, a vanished mount) journals
        `reason="ledger-inaccessible"` and steers the operator at the path's
        permissions or storage, where undecodable bytes journal
        `reason="ledger-unreadable"` and steer at the UTF-8 — the same two tokens
        and the same repairs `sweep-cycle-ledger-refused` and
        `sweep-preanswer-prune-refused` split. A `LedgerReadFault` is tested
        AHEAD of the parent class, as the read contract requires, and its
        `OSError` cause is what the token is read from: the wrapper alone, with
        no chained `OSError`, is treated as the decode arm rather than guessed
        at. The terminal harvest carry's pre-read may hand over a RAW `OSError`
        (its `read_for_write` is not wrapped), which is the OS arm outright.
        `error` is the fault's attributed text either way
        (`engine._ledger_fault_text`), which already names the ledger path and,
        for the OS arm, the `OSError` class and errno.

        The close sites are `_close_bundle_ledger_when_spec_status` (the
        accepted-dev close and review-leg reclose) and the sweep half of
        `_carry_isolated_ledger_writes`. Each is a bare
        `deferredwork.mark_done_many_reopenable`, and every mutator takes its own
        locked `read_for_write` ahead of every write, so a `LedgerReadError` from
        the call itself — including `LedgerReadFault` for OS metadata/text-read
        faults since DW-279 — proves nothing flipped: the pause costs no work.
        The terminal harvest carry also arrives here from the engine dispatch at
        either its pre-read or locked-append site. The direct pre-terminal defer
        carry deliberately stays on the engine escalation route.

        NOT `_pause_on_intent_refusal`: that tail clears the task's baseline pair,
        which is right for a task whose attempt was already rolled back and wrong
        here — an accepted dev attempt still owns its baseline, and the resume
        re-drives from it. NOT the engine's `_pause_for_ledger_repair` either: its
        `ledger-read-refused` row is the engine's inventory, and the sweep carries
        its own refusal vocabulary (`sweep-bundle-close-carry-refused` beside it).
        `gates.notify` directly, never `_notify_ledger_repair`: that helper steers
        to a fresh `bmad-loop sweep`, which abandons this run's in-flight task.

        PAUSE_STORY_GATE, not PAUSE_ESCALATION, for the reason `_pause_on_intent_refusal`
        gives: every escalation action requires Phase.ESCALATED, which none of the
        affected tasks are (DEV_VERIFY, REVIEW_VERIFY, DONE), and the gate
        stage's single action is "resume", which is the whole remedy once the
        ledger reads again. `runs.unreadable_sweep_ledger` fronts that resume for
        the MAIN checkout's ledger — the in-place sites and the carry; under
        `scm.isolation = "worktree"` the two close sites write the unit worktree's
        copy (`self.workspace.paths.deferred_work`), which the notice names via
        `error` and the gate does not probe, so an unrepaired copy simply
        re-pauses here on resume. With the phase untouched the existing resume arms redo the
        close: at DEV_VERIFY, `_recover_inflight_bundle`'s accepted-session arm
        re-enters `_resume_after_dev_verify` → `_post_dev_accepted_sync` and the
        close re-drives with no session spent; at DONE with the latch left False,
        `Engine._replay_unlatched_ledger_carries` re-runs the whole carry hook
        ahead of `_loop`; at REVIEW_VERIFY the sweep has no `_resumable_session`
        arm, so the pause takes its restart arm — `_rollback_or_pause` resets the
        attempt to baseline (rollback policy governing) and the bundle is
        re-driven from dev, whose accepted close then lands. That last is the
        pre-existing sweep resume shape, not widened here. A terminal harvested
        append pauses at DONE and replays through the same unlatched-carry
        pre-pass, which appends before attempting the close again."""

        else from the plan, so the normal case is to reuse it untouched. Returns
        `True` when a usable intent document is on disk for the task.

        Only when `_bundle_intent_reason` rejects it — gone, unreadable, or naming
        other ids — do we rebuild a degraded one from the task itself. The triage
        session's authored intent prose is the single unrecoverable piece; the
        verbatim ledger entries _write_intent re-attaches carry the actual work, so
        say plainly that they are now the contract.

        The regeneration's ledger read is CAUGHT here (DW-243), and only the
        ledger read: `_read_intent_ledger` is split out of `_write_intent` so an
        `OSError` from the intent file's own `mkdir`/`atomic_write_text_confined`
        still propagates as before. Undecodable bytes (`LedgerReadError`) and an
        `OSError` from the read journal `sweep-intent-ledger-refused` under the
        existing pair of tokens (`ledger-unreadable`, `ledger-inaccessible`) and
        then PAUSE the run through `_pause_on_intent_refusal`. Bare, the read
        crashed the resume at this exact site, ahead of any cycle gate. A pause,
        deliberately not a stop and not a doubt latch: `_finish_inflight_bundles`
        stays ungated, and a stop can never keep the "re-driven on the next
        resume" promise — `Engine._run_inner` persists `_loop`'s return as
        `finished`, which `bmad-loop resume` refuses outright. `RunPaused` leaves
        the run un-finished with `paused_*` set, which is exactly what
        `cmd_resume` accepts once `runs.unreadable_sweep_ledger` reads the
        repaired ledger.

        A READABLE ledger that lacks an entry for one of the task's ids is the
        other refusal (DW-252): `_write_intent` raises `MissingLedgerEntriesError`
        before creating anything, and this method journals
        `sweep-intent-regen-refused` (`reason="entry-missing"`; an ABSENT ledger
        takes the same kind under `reason="ledger-absent"`, naming the task's
        ids, so the operator is told to restore the file rather than entries in
        a file that is not there) and pauses the same way, with `task.bundle_file`
        and the phase exactly as they were. Pause rather than announce-and-strand:
        a stranded task beside a recovery pass that went on into fresh triage
        could have its name overwritten by a same-name bundle and its ids
        re-adopted; pausing ends the pass, so no name-reservation or ownership

        MAIN checkout after an isolated unit lands, the base having first carried
        the harvest.

        ``super()`` runs FIRST, and that is a contract rather than a style choice.
        ``deferredwork.append_entry``'s idempotence scan is OPEN-ONLY, so a close
        applied ahead of the harvest hides an already-filed row from it and mints a
        duplicate under a fresh id. The base hook now ends with a CLOSE of its own
        (``_carry_story_deferred_closes``, #458) and still satisfies the rule, since
        both of its appends precede it; the two closes never coexist on one task,
        because ``_close_declared_deferred`` is a no-op here and a story run has no
        bundle. ``_carry_harvested_deferrals`` defends the same
        hazard a second time with its own status-agnostic pre-scan, which is exactly
        why the order is pinned by a test: with that second line of defence in place
        a reversal is silent today and would only surface if the pre-scan were ever
        narrowed back to the writer's semantics.

        ``_close_bundle_ledger_when_spec_status`` writes
        ``self.workspace.paths.deferred_work`` — under ``scm.isolation = "worktree"``
        that is the unit worktree's copy. The shape this rescues is a GITIGNORED
        ledger named in ``scm.worktree_seed``: the flip lands in the worktree, then
        ``finalize_commit``'s ``git add -A`` skips the ignored path in silence, so it
        never rides the unit branch and the merge brings nothing over. The bundle's
        entries stay ``open``, ``deferredwork.open_ids`` re-bundles them, and every
        later sweep re-triages work that is already done — an unbounded loop rather
        than a one-time drop, which is what makes this worth a carry.

        An UNSEEDED gitignored ledger is a different, still-open hole this cannot
        reach: a worktree checks out tracked files only, so the ledger is absent
        there entirely, ``verify_review_bundle`` (which reads the WORKTREE's copy)
        never sees the ids ``done``, and the unit DEFERS on a fixable retry instead
        of landing. That shape is loud where this one is silent, and no DONE-leg
        carry helps a unit that never reaches DONE (#426).

        DONE leg only, deliberately: ``Engine._defer``'s isolated arm calls
        ``_carry_harvested_deferrals`` directly and never this hook, and
        ``_replay_unlatched_ledger_carries``'s DEFERRED leg matches it for the same
        reason. A defer discarded the code the close claims to have RESOLVED, and a
        close is the most expensive engine-side write to leave behind — ``open_ids``
        re-bundles only ``open`` entries, so a wrong ``done`` is invisible to every
        future sweep.

        Keyed on ``task.bundle_closes_intended``, never on the ids the in-worktree
        close managed to flip: those are exactly empty in the broken case above.
        The close is written reopenable, with the same note and operation id as the
        in-worktree close, so a carried row is indistinguishable from one that
        arrived through the merge instead of a second row shape for one event.

        No ``_generic_dev()`` guard, unlike the two ledger WRITERS: the record is
        the guard. ``bundle_closes_intended`` is assigned only by
        ``_close_bundle_ledger_when_spec_status``, which ``_post_dev_accepted_sync``
        reaches on the generic path alone, so on the legacy path — where the session
        owns the ledger — it is empty and this returns before touching anything. A
        second predicate saying the same thing would be a branch no test can redden.

        The commit is best effort, where ``_carry_harvested_deferrals`` re-raises on
        a ledger git can own. The asymmetry is deliberate: that method's raise is
        backed by ``harvest_carry_commit_pending``, so a replay still owes the commit
        after dedup empties its carried list. This carry has no such latch and its
        flips are idempotent, so a replay finds nothing left to commit — raising here
        would cost the run its ``integrate_unit`` over bookkeeping whose real work is
        already done. The flips themselves are unguarded: losing them is the hazard
        this exists to prevent.

        One fault here RAISES, as a pause rather than a crash — the mutator's own
        locked read (DW-280). ``mark_done_many_reopenable`` takes ``read_for_write``
        under the ledger lock ahead of every write, so a MAIN ledger that is
        undecodable when this half runs raises ``LedgerReadError`` from the call
        itself, before the flips the carry exists to make. That is the one fault
        the best-effort argument does not cover: nothing is on disk yet, so
        degrading would lose exactly the closes this hook is for. Bare, it crashed
        the run after the merge with ``isolated_ledger_carried`` False (neither
        ``worktree_flow.integrate_unit`` nor ``_replay_unlatched_ledger_carries``
        catches it). It now routes to ``_pause_for_bundle_close_repair`` under
        ``bundle-close-carry-locked``, the latch left False by the call site — so
        ``bmad-loop resume`` replays the whole hook through
        ``_replay_unlatched_ledger_carries`` once the ledger reads. Since DW-286
        the base half's harvest carry routes both its pre-read and locked append
        through the same sweep-owned story-gate repair route. The direct
        pre-terminal carry from ``Engine._defer`` retains the engine escalation
        route.

        A publication REFUSAL (DW-237) is best effort on strictly stronger terms.
        ``verify.unpublishable_target`` answers a different question from a
        ``GitError`` — not "can git own this path" but "is this operand a publishable
        file at all". For the three DURABLE causes — ``target-absent``,
        ``target-not-a-file`` and ``target-undecodable`` (bytes nobody can decode,
        split from the OS fault by the guard itself; DW-237) — that
        is answered off an on-disk shape a replay re-reads and refuses identically,
        so there is nothing for a raise to buy even in principle.
        ``target-unreadable`` is the one TRANSIENT cause, a probe fault the next pass
        may not see, so that argument does not cover it — but nothing here needs it
        to: this carry holds no commit latch, its flips are idempotent, and its
        commit was already best effort, so a refusal costs it exactly what a
        ``GitError`` already did. It is ``Engine._carry_harvested_deferrals``, the
        one publisher with a durable latch, that keeps ``target-unreadable`` on its
        retry path instead of refusing it — and refuses the durable three, the
        undecodable one included, because git accepts any bytes and a fall-through
        there commits the corrupt ledger. The row is journalled beside the
        ``-uncommitted`` one rather than folded into it: the two name different
        operator repairs.
