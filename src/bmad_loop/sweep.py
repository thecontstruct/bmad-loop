"""Deferred-work sweep: triage the ledger, decide, execute bundles.

A sweep is its own run type. One LLM triage session classifies every open
deferred-work entry (verified against actual code — ledger statuses are
unreliable); the orchestrator validates the result deterministically, asks
the human about decision items (interactive runs only), then drives each
work bundle through the inherited dev -> review -> verify -> commit pipeline.
The orchestrator performs all ledger edits it can do deterministically and
gates on the ones it delegates (verify.verify_review_bundle).

    is both silent and unsafe. ``deferred-work-format.md`` calls removing it
    "the exact failure this field exists to prevent", and
    ``Engine._refuse_gated_story`` then dispatches the story the entry was
    holding back.

    ``gate_tokens`` unions :attr:`~bmad_loop.deferredwork.EntryGates.tokens`
    with ``malformed`` because the question is "did a token the entry declared
    survive", not "was it enforceable". A malformed ``gate: 3.2`` gates nothing,
    but it reads to anyone scanning the entry as a gate in force and ``validate``
    reports it (``deferred.hard-gate-unstructured``); dropping it retires that
    report silently, which is the same failure one level down.

    The counts ``EntryGates`` also carries — ``lines``, ``empty``, ``near_miss``

    The restart resets ``attempt`` to 0 for a fresh budget, and that reset is exactly
    what makes the next dispatch re-mint ``attempt == 1`` — an id byte-equal to the
    abandoned attempt's, since ``engine._session_task_id`` emits its discriminator only
    above zero. The artifact a shared id corrupts is ``tasks/<id>/escalation.json``: the
    sweep skill writes it and ``resolve._gather_escalations`` reads it once per RECORDED
    session, so two records carrying one id return the abandoned cycle's escalation for
    the fresh session too. ``result.json`` is NOT at risk: both adapters unlink it in
    ``start_session``.

    Same pattern as ``runs.rearm_escalation``, DIFFERENT reason: #705's harm is
    ``_resumable_session`` verdict replay, which runs only on the dev/review phases and
    never reaches ``TRIAGE_RUNNING``/``TRIAGE_VERIFY``. ``cmd_resolve`` *can* reach a
    sweep task (``_escalate`` raises with ``PAUSE_ESCALATION`` and a story key, which
    the engine persists), and its own bump there is harmless: the re-arm leaves the task
    PENDING, so this restart arm does not fire on top of it.

    Call ONLY from the ``Phase.ESCALATED`` arm. A non-escalated restart keeps its
    attempt counter, so ``attempt += 1`` already yields a fresh id; bumping there would
    move the namespace for nothing and break the "every id already on disk stays
    byte-identical" property the suffix rule exists to hold.

        MAIN checkout after an isolated unit lands, the base having first carried
        the harvest.

        ``super()`` runs FIRST, and that is a contract rather than a style choice.
        ``deferredwork.append_entry``'s idempotence scan is OPEN-ONLY, so a close
        applied ahead of the harvest hides an already-filed row from it and mints a
        duplicate under a fresh id. The base hook now ends with a CLOSE of its own
        (``_carry_story_deferred_closes``, #458) and still satisfies the rule, since
        both of its appends precede it; the two closes never coexist on one task,
        because ``_close_declared_deferred`` is a no-op here and a story run has no
        bundle. ``_carry_harvested_deferrals`` defends the same
        hazard a second time with its own status-agnostic pre-scan, which is exactly
        why the order is pinned by a test: with that second line of defence in place
        a reversal is silent today and would only surface if the pre-scan were ever
        narrowed back to the writer's semantics.

        ``_close_bundle_ledger_when_spec_status`` writes
        ``self.workspace.paths.deferred_work`` — under ``scm.isolation = "worktree"``
        that is the unit worktree's copy. The shape this rescues is a GITIGNORED
        ledger named in ``scm.worktree_seed``: the flip lands in the worktree, then
        ``finalize_commit``'s ``git add -A`` skips the ignored path in silence, so it
        never rides the unit branch and the merge brings nothing over. The bundle's
        entries stay ``open``, ``deferredwork.open_ids`` re-bundles them, and every
        later sweep re-triages work that is already done — an unbounded loop rather
        than a one-time drop, which is what makes this worth a carry.

        An UNSEEDED gitignored ledger is a different, still-open hole this cannot
        reach: a worktree checks out tracked files only, so the ledger is absent
        there entirely, ``verify_review_bundle`` (which reads the WORKTREE's copy)
        never sees the ids ``done``, and the unit DEFERS on a fixable retry instead
        of landing. That shape is loud where this one is silent, and no DONE-leg
        carry helps a unit that never reaches DONE (#426).

        DONE leg only, deliberately: ``Engine._defer``'s isolated arm calls
        ``_carry_harvested_deferrals`` directly and never this hook, and
        ``_replay_unlatched_ledger_carries``'s DEFERRED leg matches it for the same
        reason. A defer discarded the code the close claims to have RESOLVED, and a
        close is the most expensive engine-side write to leave behind — ``open_ids``
        re-bundles only ``open`` entries, so a wrong ``done`` is invisible to every
        future sweep.

        Keyed on ``task.bundle_closes_intended``, never on the ids the in-worktree
        close managed to flip: those are exactly empty in the broken case above.
        The close is written reopenable, with the same note and operation id as the
        in-worktree close, so a carried row is indistinguishable from one that
        arrived through the merge instead of a second row shape for one event.

        No ``_generic_dev()`` guard, unlike the two ledger WRITERS: the record is
        the guard. ``bundle_closes_intended`` is assigned only by
        ``_close_bundle_ledger_when_spec_status``, which ``_post_dev_accepted_sync``
        reaches on the generic path alone, so on the legacy path — where the session
        owns the ledger — it is empty and this returns before touching anything. A
        second predicate saying the same thing would be a branch no test can redden.

        The commit is best effort, where ``_carry_harvested_deferrals`` re-raises on
        a ledger git can own. The asymmetry is deliberate: that method's raise is
        backed by ``harvest_carry_commit_pending``, so a replay still owes the commit
        after dedup empties its carried list. This carry has no such latch and its
        flips are idempotent, so a replay finds nothing left to commit — raising here
        would cost the run its ``integrate_unit`` over bookkeeping whose real work is
        already done. The flips themselves are unguarded: losing them is the hazard
        this exists to prevent.
