"""Per-unit worktree isolation + integration flow.

Extracted from :class:`bmad_loop.engine.Engine` (issue #244, findings F-3/F-9a):
``Engine`` was a god-class whose worktree/integration cluster is an independent
state machine. It lives here as a collaborator built from narrow dependencies
(repo paths, the policy, run state, journal, plugin registry, loaded adapters)
plus a handful of engine callbacks (emit a plugin hook, save state, run the
per-unit ready gate, carry isolated ledger writes, escalate-pause, and get/set
the engine's active workspace).
The collaborator never receives the whole ``Engine`` — it cannot reach engine
internals beyond those callables.

``Engine`` keeps same-name private methods that delegate here, so its tests and
the ``SweepEngine``/``StoriesEngine`` subclasses see an unchanged surface.

``provision_worktree`` (previously in ``install.py``) is rehomed here too so the
runtime control loop no longer imports the installer; ``install.py`` re-exports
it lazily for its own tests.

    Patterns are built as ``f"/{rel}"`` from real on-disk rels, but git reads them

    else entirely — and it goes wrong in both directions at once. Measured on git
    2.55.0, identical at 2.20.4 (the shield's floor):

    * ``/cfg[env]`` leaves ``cfg[env]/conf.json`` STAGEABLE. The path we seeded is
      never shielded, which is the one job the shield has (#476).
    * The same line hides ``cfge/`` and ``cfgn/``, because ``[env]`` is a class
      over ``e``/``n``/``v``. A broken pattern silently hides an UNRELATED file
      that the unit meant to commit (#401, consolidated into #476).

    An unescaped trailing space does both in one line: git drops it, so ``/kept``
    plus a space shields ``kept/`` and leaves ``kept /`` visible.

    gitignore(5)'s own escape rule is the fix — a backslash before a wildmatch
    special (``*``, ``?``, ``[``, and the backslash itself) or before a trailing
    space makes git match that character literally. ``]`` is deliberately left
    alone: it is not special without an opening ``[``, which this escapes. ``!``
    and ``#`` matter only at line start, and every pattern starts with ``/``.

    One trailing ``/`` is split off and re-appended unescaped: it is the MUSTBEDIR
    marker (``RENDER_DIR_REL``), not part of the name.

    Ordinary rels come back byte-identical, which is what makes this inert for

    """Reshape the shield patterns that name a TRACKED path; keep the rest as written.

    Git consults ignore rules only for UNTRACKED paths, so what a pattern is worth
    depends on what it names — and the two tracked shapes need opposite answers.

    A pattern naming a tracked REGULAR FILE shields nothing and costs something
    (#392, reported from production by an external user whose repo-hygiene gate then
    blocked the story's commit). Measured on git 2.55.0 with the shield's own
    private-exclude + worktree-scoped `core.excludesFile` shape, a tracked
    `.codex/hooks.json`, and its pattern present:

    * `git add -A` STAGES a modification to it anyway — ignore rules are consulted only
      for untracked paths, so the pattern never did the job it is here for;
    * `git ls-files -ci --exclude-standard` inside the worktree REPORTS it, which is the
      tracked-and-ignored state hygiene gates reject.

    So the pattern is pure cost and it is DROPPED. This is the second half of #384
    — its reporter proposed it as their option 3 ("skip any pattern whose path already
    contains tracked files … costs nothing and removes the surprising case entirely");
    PR #385 landed option 1 (scope + lifetime) and this half was dropped rather than
    rejected, which is how a second reporter hit it.

    A pattern naming a tracked DIRECTORY is that reporter's shape one step out (#484),
    and its answer is SUBSTITUTION. The measurement that used to justify keeping it
    still stands and is kept here: a dir pattern really does hide new children, and no
    pattern SHAPE both hides them and keeps the report clean — `dir/*`, `dir/**` and
    `dir` plus a trailing negation all measured identical to `dir`, because gitignore
    cannot re-include anything under an excluded parent, while the one shape that did
    clear the report (`dir/*` with per-child negations) leaked a new file into the
    commit. What reverses is the VERDICT, on the #392 physics: over a tracked tree the
    pattern's protection is already mostly inert — every modification to a tracked
    child stages regardless — so it was buying new-child coverage alone at the price of
    a false tracked-and-ignored report for the whole tree.

    The fix is therefore a different set of PATHS rather than a different shape: drop
    the dir pattern and substitute one pattern per file THIS provisioning run actually
    wrote below it (``written``). Those files are untracked by construction —
    copy-when-absent cannot land on top of a tracked child — which is why they are
    exactly the case an ignore rule works for, and why none of them is re-probed here:
    the spawn count stays one per pattern the caller built. A tracked directory that
    received nothing at all drops to no pattern, which is the same answer for the same
    reason: there is nothing of ours below it to shield.

    ACCEPTED RESIDUAL (maintainer decision on #484, 2026-08-08, which is this
    function's design authority): a file the SESSION creates under a tracked tool
    directory can be staged, where the dir pattern would have hidden it. That is the
    trade, deliberately taken — it matches the project's own decision to TRACK that
    tree, and everything the orchestrator put there keeps a pattern of its own. It is
    not a defect to fix by widening back to a dir pattern.

    APPEND-ONLY RESIDUE: `_worktree_local_exclude` never removes a line, by design —
    operator lines ride in its rewrite prefix and its last-match-wins reasoning depends
    on nothing being deleted, with no marker separating our stale line from theirs. So
    a `/dir` line an OLDER provisioning of the SAME worktree wrote survives a
    re-provision that would no longer write it. Accepted rather than fixed: the residue
    can only be too wide, never too narrow, and the private exclude dies with the
    worktree.

    Patterns ending in `/` are directory-shaped by construction (`RENDER_DIR_REL`) and
    are never probed.

    A substituted rel that cannot be spelled as ONE exclude line
    (:func:`_fits_one_exclude_line`) sends the WHOLE directory back to its dir
    pattern, journaled. That is the same trade as the degrade below and for the same
    reason: no per-file pattern exists for such a name, so substituting would leave
    the file stageable and — for a newline — write an orphan half-pattern that hides
    unrelated files.

    Degrades by KEEPING every pattern it could not resolve, in its ORIGINAL shape —
    the dir shape included, never the substitution. A shield staying too wide is
    cosmetic, while dropping or narrowing a pattern on a guess can leak the
    orchestrator's own seeded files into a story commit. Returns the surviving patterns
    and a reason for the caller to journal, or None when nothing went wrong.

    NOT-A-REPO IS SILENT, and it is the ordinary case rather than an edge one: many
    callers provision plain non-repo directories, where there is no index, no shield and
    no `git add -A` to be wrong about. The same `rev-parse --absolute-git-dir` gate
    `_worktree_local_exclude` skips on is asked FIRST, so this cannot emit a degrade per
    call and train operators past the one that matters. Only a repo that answers that
    probe and then fails the per-path one is reported."""

    `git add -A` (the skill's own commits and finalize_commit alike) into the
    story commit and merge back to the target branch, handing every other
    checkout a relay path that does not exist there. The worktree's own index
    carries a skip-worktree bit that `add -A`, `status` and checkout all honor
    (it is the sparse-checkout mechanism) and that dies with the worktree, so

    same merged-or-standalone fallback as the run-start preflight.

    Within those active skills, mirror the deterministic run-start contract rather
    than treating every descendant as fatal: reviewers require ``SKILL.md``; the dev
    primitive additionally requires its defined markers and any renderer snapshot
    sources its worktree copy resolves. Other descendants still copy best-effort,
    but their absence does not prove the outer session will write no artifact.

    A missing ``SKILL.md`` reports the coarse skill rel. A repo directory without
    ``SKILL.md`` remains the run-start preflight's concern and cannot produce a false
    CRITICAL escalation here. Stories mode adds its content-keyed dispatch probe at
    the caller, where the run mode is available.

    """Make a freshly-created git worktree a self-sufficient bmad-loop project.

    A worktree checks out tracked files only, but the skill trees (.claude/skills,
    .agents/skills), the hook config, and the project's gitignored MCP/CLI configs
    are absent from the checkout. Without them the bundled bmad-loop-* skills are missing,
    the Stop-signal hook never fires, and isolated sessions can't reach their MCP
    server. Lay the bundled skills + signal hook into the worktree for the active
    CLI profiles, and copy the `seed_files` configs in from the main repo. The
    upstream skills the orchestrator drives (BASE_SKILLS: bmad-build-auto + the review
    hunters, plus whatever review layers this project's own config names) are not
    bundled in the wheel, so they are copied from the MAIN REPO's installed tree
    instead — together with `_bmad/custom/`, the customization those layers resolve
    through, so the isolated run resolves the same layer set the preflight
    validated. Quiet (no stdout) — unlike `install_into` this runs inside the
    engine loop under a TUI. No-op when there's nothing to do.

    seed_globs are project-relative glob patterns (e.g. ".claude/skills/*") expanded
    against the main repo; every match is copied into the worktree under the same
    relative path, copy-when-absent like seed_files. A game-engine plugin uses these
    to pull its MCP-generated skill tree (gitignored, so absent from the checkout)
    into a per_worktree Editor's checkout.

    A `seed_files` entry naming a DIRECTORY whose destination already exists is
    seeded child by child: the children the checkout lacks are copied in, the ones
    it carries are left untouched. A worktree checks out tracked files, so such a
    dir always exists and the entry would otherwise be a total no-op (issue #230).

    Kept safe against the unit's eventual `git add -A` commit:
    - skills + seed files are copied only when ABSENT — at FILE granularity, so a
      project that commits its own skill tree (e.g. .agents/) or config keeps it
      untouched (no diff merged back);
    - the hook points at the MAIN repo's already-installed relay via an absolute
      path (the relay locates its events directory from $BMAD_LOOP_EVENTS_DIR,
      falling back to $BMAD_LOOP_RUN_DIR/events — never from its own location),
      so nothing is written into the worktree's .bmad-loop/. Since #494 the
      primary channel is out of the project tree entirely, so a worktree cannot
      carry a run's control plane at all — but the fallback still resolves under
      the MAIN run dir, so the guarantee holds for an older installed relay too;
    - everything we wrote is excluded from git, in a file private to THIS worktree
      (`.git/worktrees/<id>/info/exclude`, activated per-worktree) that dies with it
      when the worktree is removed. It is never the repository-wide
      `.git/info/exclude`: that file is shared with the operator's own checkout and
      permanent, so shielding through it hid every new file under a tool dir from
      their `git add -A` forever (#384). That write is best-effort: when git can't
      be queried at all it is skipped silently, but any fault after that — including
      a refusal to scope the shield, and a shield that was written but which git does
      not resolve to — is reported to `on_degraded` (once, with the reason) rather
      than swallowed, and the shield is skipped rather than widened back to the
      shared file. An unshielded worktree lets `git add -A` stage the tool files, so
      it must not fail invisibly.
    Skill trees, the per-CLI hook config, and the seeded configs all live in dirs
    projects gitignore — but the exclude shields them even when a project doesn't.

    seed_files are copied BEFORE the hook step so a seeded settings file that is
    also a hook config_path (.claude/settings.json, .gemini/settings.json) keeps its
    real content rather than being created empty. Its relay entry is replaced, not
    kept: the seeded copy carries the main repo's $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR-relative relay
    command, which resolves to the worktree, so the hook step strips it and registers
    its own absolute command in its place (#352). A config that is already there but
    cannot be parsed refuses provisioning outright — `verify.GitError`, which the
    caller escalates as CRITICAL and pauses the run — rather than being replaced by
    a hooks-only file: an unparseable config is evidence of an earlier fault, and the
    operator's bytes are left intact for inspection. The refusal sends the repair to
    whichever source supplied those bytes — read from the per-path record of what
    seeding actually wrote, never inferred from the seed entry that covers the path
    (#592).

    The repo's `_bmad/` surface is also merge-seeded, excluding generated render
    output. Renderer and upstream-skill completeness failures share the return
    channel with ordinary no-op seeds so they are journaled, but the caller re-probes
    the skill result and content-gates the renderer sentinels before escalating.

    Returns the `seed_files` entries that copied NOTHING because everything they
    name was already present, plus reserved completeness reports. A directory entry
    that seeded even one child is not a no-op and is not reported.

        `git worktree add` checks out TRACKED files only, so a project that
        gitignores its ledger — the default shape — gets a unit worktree with
        none. The orchestrator is the ledger's single writer under the generic
        dev path and writes through ``self.workspace.paths``, i.e. that missing
        copy: ``mark_done`` returns False on an absent file,
        ``verify_review_bundle`` reads the same absent file and never sees the
        ids `done`, so the bundle defers on a fixable retry and `open_ids`
        re-bundles the same work for ever (#426). No DONE-leg carry can rescue
        that — the unit never reaches DONE. Seeding moves the failure onto a leg
        that has one, where ``SweepEngine._carry_isolated_ledger_writes`` applies
        the close to the main checkout.

        The copy is not what delivers the close: every seeded rel is shielded
        from the unit's ``git add -A``, so the worktree's flip never rides the
        merge. The seeded ledger exists so the GATE can read the orchestrator's
        own write; the carry stays the delivery path, hence
        ``sweep-bundle-close-carry-uncommitted`` on a run that lands.

        Excluded: a ledger already in the checkout (without the exclusion the copy
        would be a no-op the seed loop reports as ``worktree-seed-skipped`` on every
        tracked-ledger project); one absent from the main checkout (dropped
        silently, so the entry would be invisible rather than merely inert — the
        common case, since the first harvest is what CREATES the file); and one
        resolving outside the project tree, which for an out-of-tree artifacts DIR
        ``ProjectPaths.rebased`` leaves unmoved, so the worktree already reads it.
        Presence is asked of the WORKTREE, not of git: that is the predicate the
        seed loop itself decides on, and unlike ``verify.path_tracked`` it costs no
        subprocess and cannot raise.

        A ledger that is itself a symlink keeps the dir in-tree, so ``rebased``
        moves it and the worktree path does not exist: the exclusion is still right
        for an out-of-repo target (``provision_worktree`` refuses that source
        whatever rel it is handed), but an in-repo target is seeded to the WRONG
        path and still hits #426 (#462). Resolving also names the target of a
        TRACKED ledger symlink whose target is untracked — the only path the seed
        loop will write, since it refuses to copy through a link. ``relative_to``
        decides PLACEMENT; containment is re-checked against both roots at the copy
        site.

        The structural sibling of :meth:`_ledger_seed`, for the other
        orchestrator-owned artifact in the BMAD artifacts dir, and the same shape
        for the same reason: `git worktree add` checks out TRACKED files only, so a
        project that gitignores its board gets a unit worktree with none, while the
        orchestrator writes the board through ``self.workspace.paths`` — i.e. that
        missing copy.

        What the ledger's absence costs is a livelock; the board's is a CRASH.
        ``Engine._post_dev_state_sync``'s ``advance`` returns None on a file that is
        not there (a silent no-op), and ``verify_dev`` then reads the SAME absent
        file through ``story_status``, where ``sprintstatus.load`` raises
        ``SprintStatusError`` — a class cli, operatoractions and the TUI all catch
        and neither engine.py nor verify.py does, so the story dies and takes the
        run with it. Seeding removes that structurally: the gate reads the
        orchestrator's own write instead of a hole.

        Per the maintainer decision on #350 the worktree copy is CANONICAL for the
        duration of the story. As with the ledger, the copy is not what delivers the
        advance back: every seeded rel is shielded from the unit's ``git add -A``,
        so the worktree's flip never rides the merge, and a post-merge carry is the
        delivery path.

        Excluded, arm for arm as the ledger's: a board already in the checkout
        (tracked, hence delivered — seeding it would copy nothing and journal
        ``worktree-seed-skipped`` on every isolated unit of every project that
        tracks its board, which is the common shape for this file); one absent from
        the main checkout, which the seed loop drops SILENTLY — neither
        ``worktree-seed-skipped`` nor ``worktree-seed-dropped`` — so naming it would
        be invisible rather than merely inert (a story run cannot reach here without
        a board, since ``_pick_next`` reads it first, but a sweep or stories run
        needs no board at all); and one resolving outside the project tree, which
        for an out-of-tree artifacts dir ``ProjectPaths.rebased`` leaves unmoved, so
        the worktree already reads this very file. Presence is asked of the
        WORKTREE, not of git, for the ledger's reason: it is the predicate the seed
        loop itself decides on, it costs no subprocess and it cannot raise.

        A board that is itself a symlink inherits ``_ledger_seed``'s caveat verbatim
        (#462); it is derived there and not repeated here.

        INHERITED LIMITATION — parity, not a regression, and NOT fixed here: a
        non-fixable rollback does not restore a seeded board. Rollback resets
        TRACKED paths and removes untracked NON-IGNORED ones
        (``verify.untracked_files``); an ignored board is in neither set, so nothing
        puts back the pre-attempt status. An attempt that advanced the worktree
        board to ``done`` therefore PINS it there — ``advance`` never regresses — and
        a later attempt that parks instead cannot satisfy ``verify_dev``'s
        ``awaiting-operator`` expectation. That is exactly what an in-place
        gitignored board already does under ``isolation = "none"``; only a TRACKED
        board escapes, via the rollback's ``reset --hard``. Seeding neither
        introduces the trap nor widens it.

        """The repo-relative posix paths the RUN commits for itself after the merge —
        ``clean_incoming_collisions``' ``protected`` operand (#618).

        The sprint board and the deferred-work ledger, because those are the two
        files the four post-merge carries name: ``_carry_harvested_deferrals``,
        ``_carry_review_budget_followups`` and ``_carry_story_deferred_closes`` pass
        ``paths.deferred_work`` and ``_carry_board_advance`` passes
        ``paths.sprint_status``, all four to ``verify.commit_paths`` against this same
        ``repo``. That call stages by PATHSPEC — `git add -- :(literal)<path>` — so
        whatever the working tree holds at that path is committed no matter who wrote
        it, and a merge that walked past an operator's edit there hands the run its
        own bytes to commit under a `chore(...)` message. The blast radius is strictly
        same-path (`git commit -- <pathspec>` is implicitly `--only`), which is why
        this is an exact path set and not a policy.

        ``self.paths``, not ``self.workspace.paths``: the carries read the MAIN
        checkout's copies (their docstrings say so explicitly), and this is the
        checkout the merge lands in.

        Relativized exactly as ``commit_paths`` relativizes its own operands
        (``resolve().relative_to(repo.resolve()).as_posix()``) — that is what makes
        each entry the same string the carry will later hand ``git add``, and the same
        key shape ``verify.dirty_paths`` returns, so the guard's membership test is an
        equality it cannot get subtly wrong. Resolving is load-bearing rather than
        defensive: through a symlinked artifacts dir the unresolved rel names the LINK
        while both git and ``commit_paths`` name the target.

        A path that cannot be expressed relative to ``repo`` is dropped, not raised
        on: it cannot be dirty in this checkout, and ``commit_paths`` filters the same
        ``ValueError`` and so would never commit it either. ``_ledger_seed``'s
        three-way catch for the same reason — an unresolvable path (the WSL UNC
        provider fault, a symlink loop) omits only itself.

        TRACKED ONLY, and that is the whole boundary of the hazard rather than a
        precaution. What makes the carry dangerous is committing a DIVERGENCE from a
        baseline somebody else authored: on a tracked board, an operator's local
        reopen of a story row rides out under `chore(sprint-status): carry ...` with
        the tree left clean and nothing to read it back from. An UNTRACKED artifact
        has no such baseline — git reports the whole file as dirt because git has
        never seen it, the orchestrator has been reading that exact file as its own
        all along, and committing it is how a non-ignored board first reaches git at
        all (#350's carry). Protecting it would refuse the merge on EVERY isolated run
        of any project that has yet to commit its board — measured: an untracked,
        non-ignored board with no operator dirt anywhere ends the run
        `done=0 paused=True escalated=1` — which is the unattended-halt class #460 and
        #618 exist to remove, in exchange for a "hazard" that loses nothing (the bytes
        are committed, not overwritten). A gitignored artifact never reaches the
        question: ``dirty_paths`` does not report ignored files and ``git add`` refuses
        an ignored pathspec, so the carry degrades instead of committing.

        A trackedness probe that cannot answer keeps the path, the direction
        ``path_tracked``'s own callers degrade in: uncertainty must not be what
        authorizes writing an operator's bytes into the run's commit. The cost of
        being wrong that way is a refusal the operator can act on; the other way it is
        silent.
