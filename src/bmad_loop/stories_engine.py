"""Engine variant for "stories mode" — folder+id dispatch (BMAD-METHOD #2549).

Where the default :class:`~bmad_loop.engine.Engine` walks ``sprint-status.yaml``,
``StoriesEngine`` drives a typed ``stories.yaml`` (the Story Breakdown output,
a fixed-name sibling of ``SPEC.md``). Each entry is dispatched by *spec folder +
story id* rather than a spec path: the inner ``bmad-build-auto`` skill reads its
own entry, creates-or-resumes the story spec at ``<spec-folder>/stories/<id>-<slug>.md``,
and the orchestrator reads that id-keyed path back deterministically — no
mtime-scan, no shared mutable board.

Like ``SweepEngine``, this is a thin override layer over the mature story
pipeline: only the story source (``_pick_next``), the dispatch prompt
(``_dev_prompt``), the (absent) bookkeeping sync (``_post_dev_state_sync``), the
deferral-harvest source (``_harvest_spec_path``), the board-ownership clause the
inherited review and plugin-workflow prompts inject (``_sprint_board_instruction``,
empty here — there is no board), artifact verification
(``_verify_dev_artifacts``), the session env
(``_extra_session_env``), and the HITL checkpoints differ. (That list is
illustrative and has run stale before — read the class, not it.) Everything else —
dev/verify/review/commit, crash resume, worktree isolation, gates — is inherited
unchanged.

HITL checkpoints (Phase 3) are per-story and independent (a story may set both
and pause twice):

* ``spec_checkpoint`` — a two-leg dispatch. Leg 1 sends ``Halt after planning.``
  (:meth:`_plan_halt_leg`); the skill HALTs at ``ready-for-dev``, the plan is
  verified, and the run pauses at :data:`PAUSE_PLAN_CHECKPOINT` for human plan
  review. Resume re-drives leg 2 (a plain folder+id dispatch that the skill routes
  straight to implementation) via :meth:`_resume_after_dev_verify`.
* ``done_checkpoint`` — after the story commits, the run pauses at
  :data:`PAUSE_STORY_CHECKPOINT` (:meth:`_after_story`), skipped when the story was
  the last one to dispatch.

A blocked / sentinel / ambiguous story stops the scan and escalates for resolve
(:meth:`_pause_wedged`); sentinel auto-clear on re-arm lives in
``runs.rearm_escalation``.
