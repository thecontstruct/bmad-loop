    - **empty**: ``os.path.expanduser("~")`` answers ``""`` on Windows for a
      set-but-empty ``USERPROFILE``, and ``Path("")`` is the current directory.
    - **relative**: including ``"~"`` itself, which is what ``expanduser`` returns
      when it cannot expand at all. The state root would then move with the
      launch cwd, and a run whose control plane it cannot find again is a run
      that stalls to ``session_timeout_min`` rather than one that fails.
    - **the root**: ``expanduser("~")`` answers ``"/"`` on POSIX for a set-but-empty
      ``HOME`` (``posixpath`` folds the empty prefix to the root), which would put
      ``/.local/state/bmad-loop`` on the filesystem root — a permission error for
      an ordinary user and, for a containerised root, a silent write to ``/``.

    latter is purpose-built for "must stay inside the project" guards and is

    (#498). Outside the project tree because a branch switch, a worktree mount or
    a rollback must not be able to take a live run's control plane away.

    Resolution, first answer wins:

    1. ``BMAD_LOOP_STATE_DIR``, used as the state root **itself** — no
       ``bmad-loop`` segment is appended, because the variable names our root
       rather than a base to build one under. It is honoured as spelled (see
       :func:`envvars.state_dir`) and is not passed through ``_state_base``:
       *skipping* a stated override would be a silent countermand, where skipping
       a derived base only moves on to the next guess.

       It must still be **absolute**, and a relative spelling raises rather than
       being resolved for the operator. Absoluteness is not a matter of taste
       here — the root is read by two processes with different working
       directories. The engine exports it to the session as
       ``BMAD_LOOP_EVENTS_DIR`` and the multiplexer launches that session at
       ``spec.cwd`` (a worktree under isolation), while the watcher polls it from
       the orchestrator's own cwd. A relative root therefore names two different
       directories at once: the relay writes its Stop where nothing is watching,
       and the run waits out ``session_timeout_min`` — the exact silent stall
       ``_state_base`` rejects relative *derived* bases to avoid, and the one
       this whole channel was moved out of the tree to prevent.

       Raising is not the countermand the paragraph above refuses: it names the
       variable and the fix, where absolutizing against whichever cwd this
       process happens to have would be the guess. The not-the-root half of
       ``_state_base``'s rule is deliberately *not* applied — that half exists to
       stop a broken environment's ``""`` from landing a guess at ``/``, and an
       override is not a guess.
    2. POSIX — ``$XDG_STATE_HOME/bmad-loop`` when that variable names an absolute
       path, else ``~/.local/state/bmad-loop``. A relative ``XDG_STATE_HOME`` is
       *ignored*, which the XDG base-directory spec requires of its consumers.
       (``install._shield_inherited_excludes`` resolves a relative
       ``XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` instead of ignoring it — the opposite call for the
       opposite reason: there we reproduce *git's* reading of the variable, here
       we are the spec's own consumer.)
    3. win32 — ``%LOCALAPPDATA%\\bmad-loop\\state``, else
       ``%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\bmad-loop\\state``. ``LOCALAPPDATA`` names
       the per-user, per-machine, non-roaming store Windows intends for exactly
       this, and the second form is its documented default location.

    **Never** ``Path.home()`` on the win32 arm. It is ``ntpath.expanduser("~")``,
    which prefers ``USERPROFILE`` and then falls back to ``HOMEDRIVE`` +
    ``HOMEPATH`` — a pair that on a domain-joined machine may name a network home
    share. A control plane whose atomic renames and ``O_NOFOLLOW``-anchored writes
    live on an SMB share is not the local directory this needs, and the derivation
    also disagrees with the one git uses for its own ``$HOME``
    (``install._shield_home_git_ignore`` documents that split in full). Reading
    ``LOCALAPPDATA``/``USERPROFILE`` directly asks for the store by name instead of
    inferring it from a home.

    Raises :class:`StateRootError` when no candidate answers. This is a write
    path, so it raises rather than degrading to a plausible-looking default:
    ``platform_util.resolve_or_lexical`` states the doctrine (observation may
    degrade, repair writes must raise), and the degraded outcomes here are all
    silent — a control plane at the cwd, or at ``/``, that the *next* process to
    ask resolves somewhere else.

    A *registry* is the directory a multiplexer keeps its per-session addressing

    session under ``PSMUX_DATA_DIR`` (default ``%USERPROFILE%\\.psmux``), and
    every verb resolves a session by reading that quartet back. Two processes

    run, read from a file, or taken from whatever the launching shell exported.
    See :func:`export_psmux_registry_root` for the export and its rules.

    Keyed on the project rather than on bmad-loop as a whole so a prune bug in
    one project cannot address another project's servers at all: the partition
    becomes structural instead of a filter (the ``@bmad_project`` tag stays, as
    the tmux-side answer and the belt). The price is that one ``psmux ls`` no
    longer shows every bmad-loop session on the machine — stated for the operator
    in ``docs/multiplexer-backends.md`` and printed by ``bmad-loop mux``.

    Under :func:`state_root` and not in the project tree, deliberately: a branch
    switch or a rollback that deleted a ``.port`` file would leave the server
    alive, unreachable, and invisible to ``psmux ls`` in *any* registry — a

    """Point this process — and everything it spawns — at ``project``'s registry
    by exporting ``PSMUX_DATA_DIR``. Returns the value in force afterwards, or
    ``None`` when no root could be derived.

    **The process environment, not a per-call argument.** The seam spawns every
    psmux verb through ``BaseTmuxBackend._run``, whose ``env=None`` default means
    *inherit this process's environment*, and a create-call-only injection is
    worse than none: the session's server would come up under a root every later
    ``has_session`` / ``list_window_ids`` cannot see, and those verbs report an
    unreadable registry as ``False`` / ``[]`` — a live run reading itself as gone.
    One export ahead of dispatch covers every verb in-process.

    **The root is always derived, and an ambient value never changes it.** That
    is the whole rule, and the absence of an exception is the point:
    :func:`mux_registry_root` is a pure function of (project, state root), so any
    two bmad-loop processes given the same project and the same state root agree
    — which is the entire property #537 exists to establish. A value already in
    the environment is *overridden*, and the caller says so
    (:func:`cli._configure_mux` reports it once on stderr; ``bmad-loop mux``
    discloses it).

    **Why an operator's own ``PSMUX_DATA_DIR`` is not honoured**, since honouring
    it is the obvious kindness and it was tried:

    - It would make the registry a function of the launch *shell*. A TUI started
      from the Start menu carries no profile environment and derives; a run
      started from a dev shell whose profile exports a root honours that root.
      Two registries on one machine, and a live session reading as gone in one of
      them — which is the failure this module exists to prevent, not a corner of
      it.
    - Whether honouring is even the right answer is unknowable from here. A
      process that finds a root in its environment cannot tell one the operator
      typed once in *this* shell — where a clean sibling process would derive —
      from one their profile exports into *every* shell, where a clean sibling
      honours it. The two produce byte-identical environments and want opposite
      answers, so no comparison settles it: the missing fact is the operator's
      intent, and it is not in the environment.
    - It contradicts the promise made beside it. ``BMAD_LOOP_STATE_DIR``'s
      documentation says there is deliberately no second variable naming the
      registry, because "two knobs that can disagree would put two processes on
      different registries, each blind to the other's live sessions". An ambient
      ``PSMUX_DATA_DIR`` is exactly that second knob.

    Overridden rather than *refused*, deliberately: ``PSMUX_DATA_DIR`` is psmux's
    variable, and an operator may have it set for their own sessions with no
    thought of bmad-loop at all. Erroring out of every command on such a machine
    would be bmad-loop claiming a name it does not own. The remedy runs the other
    way and ``bmad-loop mux`` prints it ready to paste: point *your* shell at
    bmad-loop's root, which is a function of the project rather than of whichever
    shell happened to launch something.

    **Overridden, but not abandoned.** A machine that had an absolute value
    exported before the upgrade kept its bmad-loop sessions in THAT registry,
    because the old backend simply inherited it — so the displaced root is
    handed to :func:`~.adapters.psmux_backend.note_displaced_registry` here,
    the last moment anything can still read it, and the migration sweep runs a
    tag-scoped pass over it alongside psmux's default
    (:meth:`~.adapters.psmux_backend.PsmuxMultiplexer.legacy_registries`).
    Without that the override would strand exactly the sessions it displaced,
    with cleanup reporting a clean machine.

    Wanting one registry to serve both is a real request and is deliberately not
    answered here. It needs a stated operator preference rather than a guess at
    one — and it must be a policy *whether*, never a *where*: ``policy.toml`` is
    written by the sessions this orchestrator drives, so a policy-sourced root
    would let a driven session choose which registry the cleanup path kills in.

    **No ``BMAD_LOOP_*`` knob for the root either.** It is derived state, not
    configuration; ``BMAD_LOOP_STATE_DIR`` already relocates it transitively —
    one knob, one cascade, instead of two that can disagree. And ``envvars.py``
    gains no entry for ``PSMUX_DATA_DIR`` itself: that module is scoped to
    ``BMAD_LOOP_*`` names and this is psmux's own, unregistered on the same
    precedent as ``PSMUX_ALLOW_NESTING``.

    **No root travels between processes.** Because every bmad-loop process
    derives its own root, nothing about a registry has to be transported at
    all. What does have to travel is the *state root*: coding-CLI windows are
    told it explicitly through their env dict (:func:`pinned_state_env`), and
    everything else — a session's window-0 shell, the TUI's parked engine
    windows — inherits it, as it always has. psmux's ``PSMUX_BARE_ENV=1`` mode
    breaks that inheritance and is **not supported**: the psmux backend warns
    once per process when it is on (see ``PsmuxMultiplexer._warn_if_bare_env``).

    Never raises. This runs ahead of *every* command, ``diagnose`` and
    ``validate`` included, and an underivable state root must not take the
    diagnostics down with it. ``None`` means "no root established": psmux keeps
    whatever it had, which is also the root cleanup sweeps as the legacy one.

    ``cli._resume_paused_run``). No file here means this run's baseline is
    reachable only through ``state.json``: it was paused before #498, or the
    project moved and keyed its state subtree somewhere new
    (:func:`project_state_root`). An *empty* file, by contrast, is a real answer
    of "no baseline" and comes back as ``""``.

    **Known limit: a file at this key can be stale (#572).** The key is the
    project's resolved path, so a project that moves away and later returns finds
    its old subtree still here — nothing can sweep it in between (FEATURES.md) —
    holding the baseline blessed before it left, while the blessing it picked up
    in between is the one in ``state.json``. Preferring the file means that older
    pin wins for one resume, which re-stamps this key and heals it. Preferring the
    fresher-looking in-tree copy is *not* the fix: it is session-writable, so it
    would hand any session the silencing #498 closed. Arbitrating by sequence
    number needs a counterpart the session cannot forge, and at equal privilege
    there is none — the same wall as #571, reached by re-keying instead of
    tampering.

    Pure observation, so it degrades rather than raising: a state root this host
    cannot name, or a file it cannot read, both answer ``None`` and hand the
    decision to the in-tree copy. The write half raises — see
    :func:`write_trusted_config_digest` — and the split is the standard one
    (``platform_util.resolve_or_lexical`` states the doctrine). Degrading here
    costs at most one advisory warning; a resume that *aborts* because an
    advisory could not be read would be the worse failure, and the resume is
    about to resolve the same state root for its events channel anyway, where
    the error is owned and reported.

    **Deliberately not ``read_text``**, and for the same reason the write is
    ``follow_symlinks=False``: this file sits in a directory the driven session
    can reach (its parent is the ``BMAD_LOOP_EVENTS_DIR`` the engine exports), so
    the *shape* of what is at the path has to be established before any bytes are
    consumed. Degrading on a hostile path is not enough when the read itself is
    the weapon:

    * ``O_NONBLOCK`` + an ``S_ISREG`` check **on the descriptor**. Opening a FIFO
      for reading otherwise blocks until someone writes — indefinitely — and
      ``resume`` is a foreground command a human is waiting on, so a planted FIFO
      wedges the terminal rather than costing a warning. The check is on the fd,
      not the path, so it cannot be raced: ``fstat`` describes the object actually
      opened.
    * ``O_NOFOLLOW``, so the name is read rather than wherever it points.
    * At most :data:`_MAX_DIGEST_BYTES`. A link to an endless source
      (``/dev/zero``) reads forever otherwise, and raises ``MemoryError`` — not
      the ``OSError`` this promises never to leak. The cap removes the condition
      instead of absorbing it.

    The POSIX-only flags degrade to 0 on win32, which has neither FIFOs at these
    paths nor ``O_NOFOLLOW``; the size cap and the regular-file check carry there
    on their own. This mirrors ``tui.launch._read_ctl_window`` deliberately — same
    hazard, same shape, one idiom. It does **not** collapse empty to ``None`` the
    way that twin does: here the two are different answers (above).

    None of this makes the baseline tamper-*proof* — a session can still delete
    the file, and #571 carries that. It stops a tampered path from hanging or

    deliberately so: a by-name kill in a shared registry without tag proof

    On a transport with no registry namespace (tmux) it is the fixed
    :data:`CTL_SESSION`, machine-shared as it has always been. On a namespacing
    transport (psmux) the name carries the registry's identity — a 16-hex
    digest of the derived registry root — because the two scopes genuinely
    differ: the session lives *per registry*, but psmux's duplicate-server
    guard is a mutex keyed on the session name alone, across every registry
    in the **login session** (``Local\\psmux-session-{name}`` over
    ``port_file_base()`` — the ``Local\\`` kernel-object namespace is
    per-login-session, not machine-global; ``server/mod.rs:853`` /
    ``platform.rs:346`` / ``types.rs:1345``, source-read at v3.3.8 —
    ``PSMUX_DATA_DIR`` never enters it). A fixed name therefore admits ONE
    control session across every registry a desktop session can reach,
    and the second project's create is rejected as a duplicate server — its
    TUI launch fails instead of minting its own session (measured: a second
    registry answers ``new-session`` rc 1 for the fixed name while the first
    registry's server lives, and rc 0 for a per-registry name).

    The digest is over ``mux_registry_root(project)`` **resolved**: the name
    must be unique per *physical* registry, and the resolved path is that
    registry's identity — (project, state root), both axes; ``project_tag``
    alone would recreate the collision for one project under two state roots.
    Resolved rather than as spelled because two spellings of one state root
    (``C:\\work\\state`` vs ``C:\\work\\alias\\..\\state``) reach **one**
    registry — Windows resolves both to the same files, and psmux keeps the
    spelling only while constructing those paths (``src/paths.rs:79``,
    source-read at v3.3.8; convergence measured) — so an as-spelled digest
    minted two control sessions inside one registry, each blind to the other's
    parked windows: the split-control-plane failure again, one level up. Same
    rule ``project_tag`` already states: resolve *before* digesting.

    …and then ``os.path.normcase``, because ``resolve()`` can only return the
    filesystem's stored case for a path that **exists**, and the registry
    root usually does not yet exist at the moment the name is needed (psmux
    ``create_dir_all``\\s it at first spawn). Two case spellings of a
    not-yet-created state root resolve to two strings, digest to two names —
    and then land in ONE physical registry, because NTFS folds case when
    psmux opens the ``.port`` files (measured). ``normcase`` folds exactly
    where the filesystem does: it lowercases on Windows and is the identity
    on POSIX, where case is significant and two case spellings ARE two
    registries — folding there would merge genuinely distinct roots.
    Ceiling, named: ``normcase`` lowercases with ``str.lower``, which can
    disagree with NTFS's own fold table for a few non-ASCII case pairs; a
    state root spelled in two such casings of the same non-ASCII name stays
    split, as it is for every other digest of an operator-supplied path.

    The degrade arm (namespaced transport, underivable state root) answers
    the fixed name: that arm runs on the transport's shared default registry,
    where a shared session scoped by per-window project tags is the correct,
    tmux-shaped semantic — and where a pre-#537 legacy ctl session under the
    fixed name may exist to be reused rather than collided with.

    prunable — but frontends surface a warning for them.

    A control session (:func:`is_ctl_session_name` — the fixed name or a
    per-registry one) is never a candidate. Pruning is scoped
    to `project` via the PROJECT_OPTION tag set at session creation:

    - tag proves this project (see accepted_tags): ours — prunable unless a
      provably-alive engine pid is running (covers finished/stopped/crashed *and*
      orphans whose run dir was deleted, since engine_liveness reads 'dead' with
      no pid).
    - tag is another project: skipped — never touched.
    - tag empty (untagged session): can't prove ownership, so fall back to the run
      dir — prunable only when the dir exists under this project and is dead;
      skipped when the dir is absent. Reachable when the tag write failed, when
      the option read degrades (session_options reads unset as "no answer", never
      as proof nothing was written), or on a session predating a working tag
      write — e.g. psmux path tags refused before the digest.

    ``require_tag`` drops that last arm: an untagged session is skipped outright
    rather than falling back to the run dir. Set for a **shared** registry — the
    legacy psmux root every project's pre-upgrade sessions sit in together (see
    :func:`prune_sessions`). The fallback proves ownership from
    ``run_dir_for(project, run_id)``, and a run id is only unique *within* one
    project (``--run-id`` is caller-supplied), so in a shared registry a dead run
    dir here is not evidence about a session over there: project A holding a dead
    `shared-id` would claim project B's live, untagged `bmad-loop-shared-id` and
    kill it. In a per-project registry the same fallback is sound because the
    registry itself proves ownership, which is why the flag is off by default and

    :func:`prunable_sessions`' untagged run-dir fallback evidence rather than a
    guess.

    That fallback claims an untagged ``bmad-loop-<id>`` session when this project
    holds a dead run dir of the same id. Run ids are only unique *within* a
    project (``--run-id`` is caller-supplied), so the claim is sound exactly when
    the registry itself already restricts what can be listed to this project's
    sessions. In a registry shared with other projects — or with the operator —
    it is not, and the same reasoning that put ``require_tag=True`` on the legacy
    pass applies here.

    The primary registry is not always ours. :func:`export_psmux_registry_root`
    degrades to ``None`` on an underivable state root and leaves whatever ambient
    ``PSMUX_DATA_DIR`` it found in force, and psmux honours any absolute value
    (``src/paths.rs``, source-read at v3.3.8) — so on that arm every verb,
    including the kill, addresses the operator's own registry while this project's
    run dirs go on looking like ownership.

    ``registry_root()`` answering ``None`` covers two cases, and they get
    **opposite** answers — conflating them was a defect, not caution. A backend
    with no registry namespace at all (tmux: one server for the machine,
    ``has_registry_namespace()`` False) keeps the reach it had before
    per-project registries existed: the listing there is exactly what it always
    was, and narrowing it would be a regression dressed as caution. A backend
    that DOES namespace and has no root in force (psmux with ``PSMUX_DATA_DIR``
    unset — the export degraded on an underivable state root and there was no
    ambient value either) is running on its transport's own **default**
    registry — shared with every other project and with the operator
    (``<home>\\.psmux``, the home being ``USERPROFILE`` when set, else the
    profile API, else ``HOMEDRIVE``+``HOMEPATH``, else ``HOME`` —
    ``src/paths.rs`` ``home_dir``, source-read at v3.3.8) — which proves nothing about
    ownership, exactly as an absolute ambient value naming a foreign registry
    proves nothing. Both shared cases make the tag mandatory.

    A backend that cannot be asked answers ``False``: the safe direction is to
    demand the tag, which leaves a session standing rather than killing one on
    evidence that may not hold.

    frontend messaging built from them always describes the performed actions.

    Runs once per registry: the one this process is pointed at, then each legacy

    bmad-loop created before it took a per-project psmux root are addressable

    ran — the migration's honest remainder, for the cleanup frontends to print.
    ``{}`` when there is no legacy registry, when they hold nothing, or when
    every listing fails.

    **Grouped by registry, and that is load-bearing.** There is more than one
    legacy registry now (:meth:`~.adapters.psmux_backend.PsmuxMultiplexer.legacy_registries`
    — psmux's default, and the root this process displaced), so a flat list
    cannot say where to go look: a message built from one would either name a
    registry the leftovers are not in, or name every registry the sweep
    addressed including the ones that contributed nothing. The operator's next
    action is to open that registry, so the answer has to be per registry. Keys
    are :meth:`registry_root`'s answer, or :data:`DEFAULT_REGISTRY_LABEL` where
    that is ``None``; a registry holding nothing is absent rather than empty, so
    a caller can print the keys without checking.

    **Presence, not a second opinion.** Called after the sweep, this lists what is
    actually there; a session the sweep killed is simply gone from the listing.
    That is the whole judgement for anything tagged as ours, and it is deliberately
    *not* a re-run of the partition: re-judging liveness would open a race the
    reader cannot see the far side of. A run alive during the prune (correctly
    left, and reported ``live``) can exit before the reader looks; a resampled
    partition would then call it ``prunable``, and it would fall out of both the
    live arm and the untagged fallback — stranded and unreported, with no kill ever
    attempted. Presence has no such gap: the session is standing, so it is named.

    What that covers, in one rule:

    - **Untagged** ``bmad-loop-<id>`` sessions. The legacy pass runs with
      ``require_tag=True`` (:func:`prunable_sessions`), so an untagged session there
      is skipped rather than claimed by a run dir that proves nothing in a shared
      registry.
    - **Ours, still standing.** Tagged this project's, and the sweep did not remove
      it — because it was live, because it exited mid-sweep, or because
      ``kill_session`` (best-effort and silent by contract) did not land. All three
      leave the same fact behind: a session of ours in a registry ordinary attach
      and cleanup no longer address. Naming it needs no cause, which is why this
      also closes the failed-kill case ``cleanup --json``'s ``sessions.removed``
      documents as an *attempted* kill.
    - **A surviving control session.** The prune never touches a ctl-named
      session (:func:`is_ctl_session_name`), and its parked windows are not swept
      in a legacy registry either — the ctl-window scan runs against the primary
      backend only. The shape question is asked through *that registry's*
      :meth:`~.adapters.multiplexer.TerminalMultiplexer.session_name_key`, never a
      constant fold: on a case-folding store ``bmad-loop-CTL-<hex>`` IS the
      control session and goes unnamed without it, while on an exact one it is a
      distinct session bmad-loop cannot have minted — naming it there would send
      the operator after somebody else's.

    Another project's tagged sessions never appear: the sweep skipping them is the
    correct outcome, not a remainder.

    ``announced`` is the one thing presence alone cannot judge: on a **dry run**
    nothing was killed, so every session the preview just announced as a would-kill
    is still standing and would be named here as if the sweep had declined it. The
    caller passes the run ids it printed — :func:`prune_sessions`' own return — and
    they are excluded.

    **Excluded only where THIS registry's own pass could have announced it**, which
    is the tagged-ours arm and only it. :func:`prune_sessions` unions the ids of
    every pass, the *primary* registry's included, so the flat set says no more
    than "some registry would kill this id" — while a legacy pass runs with
    ``require_tag=True`` and therefore cannot claim an untagged session at all.
    Applied to the untagged arm the set hid exactly the remainder this listing
    exists for: a dead ``bmad-loop-X`` the primary pass plans to kill, an untagged
    ``bmad-loop-X`` over here that the real cleanup leaves and reports, and a
    preview of that same cleanup that does not mention it.

    Inside the tagged arm the flat set is exact, so no per-registry plan has to be
    threaded down here. Liveness is read from ``run_dir_for(project, run_id)`` —
    one directory per (project, id), whatever registry the session sits in — so an
    id the primary pass judged dead the legacy pass judges dead too: if the same
    id is standing here under a tag proving ours, this pass announced it as well
    and the union merely collapsed the two.

    Passed in rather than re-derived, and that is the whole point of the parameter.
    An earlier revision re-ran the partition here to rediscover the plan, which is
    a *second sample*: a tagged legacy run seen alive by the first (so printed as
    live, never announced) can exit before this call, land in the second sample's
    prunable arm, and be excluded from a listing it should have headed — a session
    dropped from the preview outright, not merely mentioned twice. Consuming what
    the preview actually printed cannot disagree with it.

    On a real cleanup the caller passes nothing: there, a killed session is gone
    from the listing by presence, and one whose kill did not land must be named.

    Deliberately its own listing rather than a fourth arm on
    :func:`prune_sessions`. That tuple is read by two frontends and projected into
    the schema-versioned ``cleanup --json`` document; widening it is a contract
    change and ~30 call sites, against one extra pair of psmux calls against a
    registry that answers "no server" instantly on any machine that never ran the
    pre-registry build.

    Names, not run ids: the ctl session has no run id, and the operator is going to
    paste these into a ``psmux`` target — under the registry this maps them to,
    which is the other half of what makes them pasteable.

    both stage over one name and the loser's ``os.replace`` raises
    ``FileNotFoundError`` after the winner's consumed it; on the hard path that
    would abort ``stop_run`` *before* it ever signals. A ``mkstemp`` temp per writer
    removes the collision: the last replace wins and neither writer errors.

    Refusing a link at the control file preserved what the bare ``os.replace``
    did — it never dereferenced this destination — and matches what the file is:
    machine-minted control state under a run dir a driven session can reach. The
    write is now confined to the project root (#593), because that refusal
    covered only the final component: every directory above it was still looked
    up by name, so a link planted at ``.bmad-loop/`` — or at ``runs/``, or at the
    run's own directory — aimed both the temp and the publish wherever it
    pointed. The file still lands at ``mkstemp``'s ``0600`` instead of
    ``0644 & ~umask``, since no-follow never inherited a mode either; nothing
    reads it cross-user.

    No ``require_writable_target``: this is not an operator-curated file but a
    channel two ``stop`` invocations race on, and its whole contract above is
    that the stronger request always lands."""

    """Lodge a *graceful* request only if none is pending; False when one already is.

    ``O_CREAT | O_EXCL`` is the arbitration. It makes "is a request pending?" and
    "lodge mine" one atomic step against the destination name, so a hard request
    landing at any instant either already exists — we refuse, leaving it standing —
    or replaces what we wrote, which is escalation, the direction
    :func:`_write_stop_request` owns. A re-read immediately before an unconditional
    replace could only ever *narrow* that window (~1.3ms on a journalling
    filesystem, where the fsync dominates); this closes it.

    Graceful-ONLY by construction, and that is what makes the non-atomic body safe.
    The bytes are written *into* the created file rather than replaced in, so a
    concurrent reader can catch it empty — and :func:`read_stop_request_mode`
    answers ``"graceful"`` for a present-but-unparseable body, which is the very
    mode being written. The invariant that matters is untouched: a torn read must
    never produce ``"hard"``, so a hard writer must keep the atomic replace.

    Refuses a planted symlink rather than following it — ``O_EXCL`` never
    dereferences — which is stricter than the ``follow_symlinks=False`` replace it
    replaces. That refusal covers only the FINAL component, though, so the create
    goes through :func:`platform_util.create_exclusive_confined` (#593): a link
    planted at ``.bmad-loop/``, ``runs/`` or the run's own directory was still
    resolved by name and aimed the request outside the project, exactly the hole
    the confined :func:`_write_stop_request` next door already closed. The
    anchored create keeps the exclusive arbitration this function is built on;
    an unreachable parent raises ``UnconfinedWriteError``.

    A failed write is deliberately NOT rolled back, and that is load-bearing rather
    than sloppy. ``unlink`` resolves a *name*, not the inode this call created, so a
    rollback here would delete whatever occupies the path at that moment — including
    a ``"hard"`` request a concurrent ``stop`` escalated onto it while this write was
    in flight. That is a ``hard -> absent`` drop, the one descent the mode lattice
    :func:`consume_stop_request` documents must never happen, and on native Windows
    it would silently withdraw the only channel that can stop the engine. Guarding it
    is not available: an "unlink only if still my inode" step does not exist as one
    atomic operation, and both check-then-unlink shapes measure *worse* than no guard
    at all — the check moves the decision earlier and the destructive act later by
    its own cost, shifting the window rather than narrowing it (inode compare 1.39x,
    mode compare 2.30x, over a rendezvous-synchronised escalation sweep on btrfs).

    What a failed write leaves behind is a short or empty body, which
    :func:`read_stop_request_mode` reads as ``"graceful"`` — exactly the mode this
    function was asked to lodge, for the one caller (``stop --graceful``) that an
    operator drove. It does not wedge the channel: a later graceful ask answers
    "already-pending", a later *hard* stop supersedes it unconditionally, and
    ``stop --cancel-graceful`` or ``resume`` withdraws it. Leaving a graceful request
    standing is the bounded direction this channel already leans on everywhere else."""

    The reader-side counterpart of :func:`_create_stop_request`'s
    ``O_CREAT | O_EXCL``: the rename *is* the consume, so "what mode is pending?"
    and "take it" cannot disagree. A read followed by an unlink can, and the gap is
    not academic — a concurrent ``stop`` escalating to ``"hard"`` in between is
    deleted unread while the caller routes on the stale ``"graceful"`` it already
    holds.

    Only that direction can lose anything, because the mode lattice is monotone:
    the graceful writer refuses to overwrite an existing request and the hard writer
    only ever writes ``"hard"``, so ``absent < graceful < hard`` until consumed. A
    stale ``"hard"`` read is therefore always still true; a stale ``"graceful"`` may
    not be.

    Monotone requires that no writer *descends* either, which is why
    :func:`_create_stop_request` has no rollback on a failed write: an ``unlink``
    keyed on the path rather than the inode it created is a ``hard -> absent`` drop,
    and it would put a second way to lose a hard request in a *writer* — leaving the
    three read-then-unlink sites in ``engine.py`` that rely on this argument resting
    on something untrue.

    Re-reading the mode immediately before the unlink does NOT fix this, and is a
    trap worth naming: measured over 4000 injected races it made the loss *more*
    likely, not less (164 -> 929 swallowed), because the extra read lengthens the
    interval an escalation has to land in. Narrowing a window is not closing it —
    only one atomic step is.

    The request is delivered two ways at once, and the engine wins whichever race
    it can: a ``mode: hard`` :data:`STOP_REQUEST_FILE` is lodged *first*, then the
    engine is signalled. SIGTERM is the POSIX fast path — the handler stops the run
    within the tick. The file is what makes the stop work where the signal cannot
    land: a native-Windows engine never receives an inter-process SIGTERM, so before
    #319 every Windows stop burned the full grace window into a blind force-kill.
    Now the engine reads the file at its next item boundary, or mid-session in the
    adapter wait loop, and performs its own teardown either way.

    That ordering is the whole point: lodging before signalling means the engine can
    never exit the signal path having missed a request that was only written after.

    Either way the engine stays the single writer of `stopped` (it marks the run,
    kills its in-flight agent window, and exits). Falls back to an external kill +
    mark when there is no live engine pid, it is a legacy run, or it does not exit
    in time. A wedged engine that ignores both channels past the grace window is
    force-killed — but only while we can still prove the pid is the same process we
    signalled (a pid-reuse guard); otherwise we raise StopRunError rather than risk
    killing an unrelated process.

    The lodged file is consumed by whoever settles the run: the engine when it
    honors the request, or this function on the paths where nothing is left alive to
    read it. Both exceptions to that turn on the same question — did we ever *prove*
    the engine dead? Where we did not, the file stays lodged, because it is then the
    only channel that can still stop it: the StopRunError refusal below (we decline
    to force-kill an unverifiable pid), and the ``engine_may_live`` paths where the
    signal or the kill was refused outright rather than racing us to exit.

    **Registry scope, stated because it is easy to read past.** The stop
    itself is registry-independent: both channels address the engine *process* —
    the request file lands in the run directory, the signal on the pid recorded
    there — and a run directory is per (project, run id), not per registry. So a
    pre-upgrade run living in a legacy psmux registry stops, and a still-live
    engine tears down its own window under the registry it was launched with.
    What is scoped is the backstop below: :func:`kill_session` addresses the
    registry THIS process exported, so an agent session an already-dead engine
    leaked in a legacy registry is not reached from here and the run is marked
    stopped with that session standing.

    Deliberately not widened, and for the reason ``kill_session``'s own docstring
    gives: a by-name kill in a registry shared with other projects, without tag
    proof, could take a neighbour's same-named session — run ids are unique per
    project only. Both legacy registries are shared in exactly that sense. The
    displaced one is no exception: it is the *ambient* ``PSMUX_DATA_DIR`` this
    process found (:func:`~.adapters.psmux_backend.note_displaced_registry`), so
    a profile that exports one exports it into every project's shell and every
    one of them kept its pre-upgrade sessions there. That is why the legacy pass
    of :func:`prune_sessions` demands the tag in both, and it is the path that
    reaches such a session — ``bmad-loop cleanup``, with
    :func:`legacy_registry_leftovers` naming whatever the tag rule leaves and the
    registry it is in.

def live_session_may_be_ours(project: Path, run_id: str) -> bool:
    """True when a live ``bmad-loop-<id>`` session exists that this project cannot
    prove belongs to another one — the precondition of the removal guard below.

    Ownership is read exactly as :func:`prunable_sessions` reads it. A tag outside
    :func:`accepted_tags` proves the session foreign, and a *tagged* session carries
    its own ownership proof, so it does not need this project's run dir at all:
    answering False there keeps the guard off a removal that provably strands
    nothing. Untagged, or tagged as ours, answers True — neither can be ruled out
    as depending on this run dir, and only the untagged case is load-bearing.

    An observation, so it degrades rather than raising, and each read degrades in
    its own direction. A listing that cannot answer reads as "no session": that is
    already what the bundled backend returns for a missing multiplexer, a dead
    server or a failed query, and a guard that varied by backend would be worse
    than no guard. A tag that cannot be read is *not* proof the session is foreign,
    so it reads as untagged and the refusal stands — by then the listing has
    already established that a session is live.

    Both reads are caught explicitly because the seam permits a raise: only
    `pipe_pane` and `kill_session` are contractually best-effort, so an
    out-of-tree backend raises :class:`MultiplexerError` here where the bundled
    one returns empty (docs/adapter-authoring-guide.md). The listing is checked
    first, so the tag query only runs on a name collision.

    A stronger shape was built and withdrawn: a proof discipline (block unless
    the transport *proves* the session absent) fell to four consecutive reviews,
    each refuting its newest proof source — the transports genuinely offer none.
    psmux's registry is advisory and self-healing (its server re-creates a
    reaped port file on a 5 s tick, source-read at v3.3.8), a binary's PATH
    presence is per-process while the server is not, and the listing is
    load-sensitive; so a "proof of absence" either wedges every removal behind
    `--force` or quietly accepts a refutable proof.

    Revisited with the cost measured (#732), and the degrade is KEPT — not for
    want of a stronger read, but because the more dangerous of the two costs
    reaches this function as an ordinary answer. On psmux 3.3.8 a live session's
    registry entry is reaped by any `has-session` whose 500 ms connect does not
    land, and until the server's registry maintenance re-writes it the listing
    does not name that session while reporting no fault at all: exit **0**, no
    stderr (measured; the listing empty in that run because the session was the
    only one, the server pid alive throughout, the entry back 1.7 s later).
    That maintenance runs when the server's own loop notices 5 s have elapsed —
    a nominal interval, not a scheduling guarantee, so 1.7 s is a sample and 5 s
    is not a bound. The listing therefore does not fail, it answers wrongly —
    and the read this guard makes is the one with no discrimination in it at
    all. ``mux_sessions()`` lands on ``BaseTmuxBackend.list_sessions``, which
    returns ``[]`` under the three conditions its own comment names — the binary
    is missing, no server is running, or the query itself fails — and says
    nothing about which. None of the three raises: the bundled backend folds
    ``SubprocessError`` and ``OSError`` into that same sentinel, and only an
    out-of-tree backend raises ``MultiplexerError`` here. Nor does the
    diagnostic #525 added: ``_warn_unproven_listing`` sits on
    ``session_options`` and the window path, not on this one. And the reap
    reaches none of those branches anyway, because its exit is 0. So there is
    neither a signal to condition on nor a word on stderr about it.

    The second cost lasts as long as its cause: a process whose PATH lacks the
    binary reads every session as absent for as long as that PATH does (measured
    through the seam — the sessions reappear when PATH is restored), because the
    binary is per-process while the server is not. That one is no mystery to the
    transport: ``list_sessions`` decides it from ``shutil.which`` on purpose,
    being one of the two methods that report what exists, and folds it into the
    same ``[]`` deliberately (its own comment: the absence of sessions and the
    absence of the multiplexer are indistinguishable here). The fold is the
    seam's decision; what reaches this function is its result.

    What the two costs share is not a shape but a verdict. A reap takes one
    session's entry, so its listing may still name every other session on the
    box; a missing binary yields nothing at all. Both arrive as the same
    *negative membership* — this run's name is not in the listing — which is
    exactly what a genuinely dead session produces, and there is no fourth
    answer to distinguish them by.

    The named alternatives were weighed and refused. Retry-with-delay, in the
    shape this guard could hold, pays a delay on every removal that finds no
    session — the common case — once per run inside `clean`; a retry hoisted to
    command scope would pay it once, but neither can bound a window whose close
    is a nominal tick rather than a deadline. A tag-first read draws on the same
    listing and is blind in exactly the same window. Warning whenever the
    multiplexer is unusable fires on every box that simply has no multiplexer,
    which is the noise ``BaseTmuxBackend._warn_unproven_listing`` already stays
    silent about. What is left is the accepted ceiling, written down here and in
    docs/FEATURES.md so an operator meets it as a documented limit rather than a
    surprise.

    The psmux half is a *defect*, not a design: four sibling reap sites in that
    binary gate on `ConnectionRefused` precisely because "a timeout means
    busy-but-alive and must not be deleted" (its own comment), the `has-session`
    site does not, and tmux 3.4 blocks rather than reaps under the same
    treatment (measured). Reported as psmux/psmux#622, which is the thing to
    watch. Retiring it takes two parties, though, and an upstream fix alone is
    not enough: the reap window closes for this project once a psmux release
    repairs that site AND the supported floor is raised to that release or
    later, since an installed 3.3.8 keeps reaping whatever master does. And it
    retires only itself — the PATH case is ours, and so are the two arms above
    it, a backend that cannot be selected and a listing that raises. What that
    fix removes is one measured case, not the ceiling.

    Two registry-root-era additions on that unchanged contract:

    **The control-alias discount.** An id whose session name is one of THE
    control session's own names — the fixed :data:`CTL_SESSION`, or this
    project's :func:`ctl_session_for` — answers False before any transport
    read: that session is the control plane's, never claimed through a run
    dir, so its liveness is not evidence about the run, and blocking removal
    on it wedged exactly the recovery (`bmad-loop delete ctl`) the resume
    refusal points an operator at, for as long as the machine had a control
    session at all. This is the *instance* question, deliberately not
    :func:`run_id_aliases_control_session`'s shape question: on tmux a
    `main`-created run `ctl-<16 hex>` owns a genuine agent session distinct
    from the fixed name (measured: killing it exactly leaves `bmad-loop-ctl`
    alive), and the shape discount destroyed its run dir without ever querying
    the mux. A namespace probe that cannot answer degrades to the fixed name
    alone — the *smaller* discount, which blocks more, the safe direction. A
    discount, not a proof source: it removes non-evidence, and never clears a
    removal on transport testimony.

    **Transport-owned name comparison.** Every comparison goes through
    :meth:`session_name_key`, never a constant fold: psmux resolves names
    through a case-folding store, tmux is case-sensitive (both measured), and
    a constant ``.lower()`` discounted a persisted `CTL` run's genuinely live
    uppercase agent on tmux as "the control session" and deleted its run dir.
    On tmux the key is identity, so the listing and tag reads keep their
    historical exact comparison. Selecting that backend is itself part of the
    listing read — :func:`mux_sessions` selects inside the caught call — so it
    degrades the listing's way: a transport that cannot even be chosen (a
    persisted `[mux] backend` naming a backend no longer registered) reports
    no live session rather than aborting every removal path."""

    Every caller's live guard is keyed on *engine pid* liveness, so an orphan —
    engine dead, agent session still alive in the multiplexer — passes all of them.
    That is the one state where the run dir is load-bearing: for an untagged
    session it is the only ownership proof :func:`prunable_sessions` can read, so
    removing it leaks the session (and its server) for the life of the machine.
    Refusing is a repair-path write failing loudly, per the module doctrine.

    Scoped to what it can justify: a session this project can prove is another
    one's does not block anything (see :func:`live_session_may_be_ours`). Refusing
    there would strand nothing and wedge every removal path — including `clean`,
    which has no override — for as long as the other project's run lives.

    Never a kill from here: a session name carries no project, so killing
    `bmad-loop-<id>` by name would tear down another project's live run whenever the
    two share a run id (reachable — `--run-id` is caller-supplied).

    The message names `bmad-loop cleanup` as the remedy but does not call it sound.
    `prune_sessions` proves ownership from the tag when there is one and falls back
    to *this same run dir* when there is not — the weak proof this guard exists to
    protect, so on the untagged case it can prune another project's session on a
    shared run id (#419's second edge, pinned by
    `test_prunable_sessions_claims_an_untagged_session_on_a_run_id_collision`).
    Hence the message asks the operator to confirm first: nothing available here can
    prove the session ours, and minting a proof that outlives the run dir is #419

    A **never-raise tail**, per the teardown doctrine (#139): the run dir is

    The containment half of #480, and deliberately independent of how the ref was
    spelled: :func:`_is_path_escape` gates the *string* an operator typed, this
    gates the *path* the two destructive writes are about to hand `shutil.rmtree`.
    Both are wanted. `delete_run` and `archive_run` are module-public and take a
    `run_dir` outright, so a caller that composed one by some route other than
    :func:`resolve_run_dir` — the TUI's selection, a record read back from disk, a
    call site not yet written — never passes the ref guard at all.

    ``run_dir_for`` is the sole builder of these paths, so recomposing one from
    the basename and comparing is exactly the "is a direct child" question: the
    runs root itself, a nested grandchild, and anything outside the project all
    differ from what it returns. Comparing against the rebuild rather than
    walking `parents` keeps this tracking `RUNS_DIR` the way
    :func:`_project_of_run_dir` does. The rebuild has one blind spot the name
    check closes: ``.name`` of ``runs / ".."`` is ``".."`` and the rebuild
    reproduces it verbatim, so the lexical equality holds while `rmtree` would
    resolve it to ``.bmad-loop`` itself. pathlib drops ``"."`` at parse so only
    the ``".."`` spelling survives to here; ``"."`` is refused anyway rather than
    reasoned about.

    The link walk below the equality check refuses a REDIRECTED spelling of a
    contained path: with ``.bmad-loop``, ``runs`` or the run dir itself replaced
    by a symlink (or, on Windows, an unelevated ``mklink /J`` junction — why this
    is :func:`is_link_like` and not ``is_symlink``), the rebuild is lexically
    identical while `rmtree` follows the redirect and removes a tree outside the
    project. A planted redirect is this module's live threat class (see the #591
    notes in :func:`archive_run`). The walk stops short of ``project`` — the
    operator's own argument, and a project addressed through a symlinked home is
    legitimate — and covers only the orchestrator-owned levels under it. It is
    check-then-act, not fd-anchored like `journal.py`'s writes: `resolve()` is
    banned here (it can raise on a WSL-UNC host — `tests/conftest.py`'s
    ``refuse_to_resolve``), `tarfile` cannot take a dir fd at all, and the racer
    that could re-plant between check and rmtree is a live session, which the
    guard below this one refuses anyway.

    Raises rather than degrading — observation may degrade, a repair write must
    not: there is no partial `rmtree` to fall back to, and declining quietly would
    report a removal that never happened. :class:`UnconfinedWriteError` is the
    shape-refusal this module already raises for the same class of mistake (see

    ``force``), before any archive path is created, so a refusal leaves nothing
    behind.

    The tarball holds the run dir only, so since #494 an archive no longer carries
    the run's ``events/``: the channel moved out of the tree, and its files are
    transient completion signals the watcher has already consumed — the recorded
    decision accepts losing them from the archive. Everything an archive is read
    for later (state, journal, tasks, logs) is in the run dir and unaffected.

    Containment (see :func:`_refuse_uncontained_run_dir`) is checked ahead of both,
    for the reason the session guard runs early: a refusal must leave no archive
    directory and no tarball behind.

    ``wait_for_lock`` carries the meaning it has on :func:`delete_run`: ``False``
    declines a contended run with :class:`platform_util.LockUnavailableError`
    rather than queueing behind its holder, and refuses before the tarball is

    quietly. Without it the state root accumulates one dead subtree per run
    forever, on a path outside the project that no operator thinks to look at.

    Shaped like :func:`reconcile_orphan_worktrees`: enumerate on-disk truth,
    containment-test each path, remove with failures tolerated. Returns what was
    removed (or, under ``dry_run``, what would be).

    Every path is built from an entry name this function itself enumerated —
    never from a caller-supplied ref, which is what :func:`_is_path_escape`
    refuses on the ref-resolution path. Entries that are not real directories are
    skipped, symlinks included: a link is not a state dir we created, and
    reporting one swept would be a false count even where ``rmtree`` refuses it.
    The containment test then covers what ``is_symlink`` cannot — a Windows
    *junction* reads as a plain directory while ``resolve()`` follows it, so
    without the test ``rmtree`` would empty a target sitting outside the root.
    That case is POSIX-invisible, and the tests say so rather than claim it.

    Degrades to no-op rather than raising, in either direction: an underivable
    state root, an unreadable root, or an unreadable runs dir all sweep nothing.
    This is reclamation, not repair — leaving disk behind is the cheap outcome,
    and removing a live run's control plane is not.

    Both guards hold ``RuntimeError`` alongside ``OSError`` for the same reason
    :func:`_discard_state_dir` does: every path here is resolved (the project by
    :func:`project_tag`, then the root, then each entry), and below 3.13
    ``Path.resolve`` reports a symlink loop as ``RuntimeError``. A loop planted
    among the entries would otherwise escape a sweep whose whole contract is to
    degrade, and take the operator's ``clean`` down with it after its real work
    was already done.

    **The two reads are ordered, and the order is the whole race guard.** State
    entries are enumerated *before* the live run-dir names, because a run creates
    its run dir strictly before its state dir — ``compose_run`` builds the
    ``Journal`` (which mkdirs the run dir) and only then stamps the config digest
    (:func:`write_trusted_config_digest`, the earliest writer into the state dir
    since #498) and calls ``make_adapters``, whose ``SignalWatcher`` mkdirs the
    events dir alongside it. Reading entries first makes
    that ordering carry the guarantee: anything in ``entries`` had its state dir
    on disk at the first read, so its run dir was on disk *before* that, so the
    later ``live`` read is certain to contain it. Read the other way round, a run
    starting in the gap is missing from ``live`` and present in ``entries``, and
    an operator's ``clean`` deletes the control plane of a run that is starting
    right now — whose watcher then polls a primary that no longer exists, or
    simply never sees the Stop. A run dir that disappears *between* the reads is
    the opposite case and correctly swept: it is a real orphan by then.

    """The refusal a resume-shaped entry point owes a sweep run whose ledger cannot
    be read — bytes that do not decode (DW-204) or a read the OS refuses (DW-234).

    Returns the operator-facing message, or None to decline (DW-204).

    A sweep run's whole job is reading and rewriting the deferred-work ledger, so
    resuming one over a ledger nobody can read arms the run — pid publication,
    policy re-stamp, a `run-resume` journal row — and only then meets the ledger.
    The run's own read degrades rather than raising (`sweep._read_cycle_ledger`,
    DW-197), so the cost is not a crash but a wasted arm and a stop whose repair
    route this surface never offered: every repair steer in the product
    (`sweep._notify_ledger_repair`, the ATTENTION line, docs/FEATURES.md) routes to
    a fresh `bmad-loop sweep`, and `resume` was the one that silently accepted the
    attempt instead.

    Reachable domain — narrower than it looks. A sweep ENDED by a ledger fault
    returns from `SweepEngine._loop`, and `Engine._run_inner` sets
    `state.finished = True` on that return, so DW-204's own literal end state is
    persisted finished and is refused by `_prepare_resume_locked`'s `already
    finished`, which this gate declines to re-word. What is left, and what this
    gate is for, is the UN-finished sweep runs — paused at an escalation, the
    migrate gate or an in-flight bundle's intent-regeneration refusal (DW-243: the
    recovery pass pauses at the story gate rather than stopping, precisely so the
    task is re-driven by a resume this gate fronts), operator-stopped, or crashed
    — whose ledger is unreadable at the moment someone resumes them.

    Scope, all deliberate:

    * `read_for_write`, never `read_for_observation` — this gates a run that will
      WRITE the ledger, so it must ask the arm that refuses to publish from a text
      nobody could read.
    * `LedgerReadError` is caught BY NAME. It is a plain `Exception` on purpose
      (DW-146) so that no OSError handler can swallow it; the flip side is that
      nothing catches it implicitly either.
    * `OSError` IS caught here too, with its own permissions-or-storage repair —
      the RECORDED REVERSAL (DW-234). The arm was first written at `e609604c`,
      then struck by the DW-204 human resolution on SCOPE grounds: that resolution
      froze this gate to the decode fault so DW-204 could ship without
      re-litigating the DW-146 reader contract, and two propagation rows pinned
      the exclusion. The steer the exclusion lost was real — before this gate, an
      OS-refused ledger armed the run and stopped through `_read_cycle_ledger`'s
      `ledger-inaccessible` arm WITH `_notify_ledger_repair`'s route, and the gate
      then let the same fault reach `main`'s tail as a routeless
      `error: [Errno 13] …` naming no repair at all. DW-204 has shipped, DW-234
      carries the accepted 2026-09-09 decision to add the arm back, and this is
      that arm: it shares the `bmad-loop sweep` + clean-worktree ROUTE
      `sweep._notify_ledger_repair` already gives the sweep run for the same
      fault (that notice names the route and nothing about the fault's class),
      and the permissions-or-storage attribution is this arm's own. The arm is a
      CALLER's: since DW-279, `deferredwork.read_for_write` wraps OS failures
      as `LedgerReadFault`, handled before the decode parent here to preserve
      the original OS attribution. `tui.app._do_rearm` no longer wraps the probe
      in its own `except OSError` — with the arm here the probe cannot raise one, so that
      stopgap was dead code.
    * Absence is NOT a refusal. `read_for_write` answers None, and `open_ids("")`
      / `parse_ledger("")` answer identically for absent and empty — a resumed
      sweep on an absent ledger ends cleanly at `sweep-nothing-open`, unless it
      holds an in-flight bundle whose intent document must be regenerated: that
      run re-pauses at the story gate under `sweep-intent-regen-refused`
      `reason="ledger-absent"` (DW-243/252) before any cycle runs. A bundle close
      paused at the same gate under `sweep-bundle-close-refused` — the mutator's
      own locked read at the accepted-dev close, review-leg reclose or isolated
      close carry (DW-280), plus either read site in the terminal post-merge
      harvested append (DW-286) — resumes the same way once the ledger reads.
      This gate fronts that resume for the MAIN checkout's ledger (the terminal
      carry and the in-place close sites), and the existing recovery arms then
      re-drive the write. Under `scm.isolation = "worktree"` the two in-worktree
      close sites write the unit worktree's copy, which the pause notice names
      and this gate does not probe, so an unrepaired copy simply re-pauses on
      resume.
    * Story runs are out of scope, and since DW-231 (undecodable bytes) and
      DW-258 (a read the OS refuses) that is SAFE rather than merely decided at
      the engine's four direct `read_for_write` sites. Its observation reads
      (`_ledger_digest`, the pre-harvest and defer snapshots, the two restores)
      degrade to a typed answer nothing can write back and journal
      `ledger-read-degraded`; its two publish reads (the spec-deferral harvest
      and the isolated carry) pause the run with an `ACTION REQUIRED` repair
      notice and no phase change, so `bmad-loop resume` after the repair retries
      the write — replaying the recorded session result where one exists,
      re-driving the leg otherwise. The exception is a sweep's terminal
      post-merge harvest carry: its caller-sensitive dispatch uses the sweep
      story gate above, while a direct pre-terminal sweep defer carry retains the
      engine escalation route. At those four sites a story run over an
      undecodable OR OS-refused ledger therefore no longer dies as `run-crash`.
      Since DW-259 the mutators' locked re-reads route the same way for decode
      faults, and DW-279 extends that route to OS metadata/text-read faults:
      every `deferredwork` mutator takes its own locked
      `read_for_write` — after a routed pre-read at the harvest and the harvest
      carry, after an observation snapshot at the commit-boundary close, and with
      no pre-read at all at the review-timeout salvage refile
      (`deferredwork.append_entry` in `engine._salvage_review_timeout`) and the
      isolated close carry — so a `LedgerReadError` raised from the mutator call
      itself (the harvest's mark and append, the commit-boundary close, the
      salvage refile, the isolated carries' append and close) now pauses through
      the same `ledger-read-refused` route under a site name ending in `-locked`,
      with the phase untouched. `LedgerReadFault(LedgerReadError)` identifies
      OS read failures with the original `OSError` chained; pre-lock presence
      probes, lock acquisition and writes keep their raw `OSError` behavior.

    Timing — a best-effort ENTRY SNAPSHOT, never a guarantee about the inputs the
    run actually arms. The probe reads `load_state` / `bmadconfig.load_paths` at its
    caller's entry, ahead of `_resume_paused_run`'s `state_lock`;
    `_prepare_resume_locked` re-loads both UNDER that lock and publishes the pid
    from ITS reads, so a config change landing in that window selects a ledger this
    probe never saw. That race is ACCEPTED rather than closed, and the reason it
    can be: its outcome is exactly pre-DW-204 behavior — the run arms and its own
    read degrades to a `sweep-repeat-done` stop (DW-197) — so an entry snapshot can
    only improve on what this surface did before, never regress it. **No under-lock
    re-probe may be added**, and not for cost: `_prepare_resume_locked` /
    `_resume_paused_run` are also `resolve`'s re-arm path, so a refusal sited there
    lands after resolve's interactive session has run and its escalation is spent —
    exactly the failure `cmd_resolve`'s own entry gate exists to prevent. That
    deferral is now settled (DW-229, DW-230), and settled at the callers rather
    than here: `cli.cmd_resolve` and the TUI's `_do_rearm` call THIS function at
    their own entries — resolve at the end of its pre-side-effect gate block,
    ahead of the interactive session and `rearm_escalation`; the TUI beside
    its alias/liveness gates, ahead of the same re-arm and of the detached resume
    whose refusal would land in a pane nobody opens. Three entry points, one
    implementation, and still no probe under the lock: this function lives in
    `runs` (the CLI+TUI shared-helper module) precisely so a second surface takes
    the gate by CALLING it rather than by copying it or by sinking it into shared
    machinery that runs too late. Each caller owns its own channel — stderr plus
    `ExitCode.FAILURE` in the CLI, an error toast in the TUI — which is why the
    probe stays pure `(project, run_dir) -> str | None` and answers with the
    operator-facing string or declines.

    What this gate defers to, precisely. It declines for a `finished` run and for a
    control-session-alias id, so `_prepare_resume_locked` keeps `already finished`
    and its "recover by hand, then `bmad-loop delete`" verbatim. It PRECEDES
    `_reject_under_floor_git`, `_reject_isolation_conflict`, `_require_base_skills`
    and the under-lock `runs.is_run` -> `no such run`, so a sweep run blocked by one
    of those AND holding an undecodable ledger is told to fix the ledger first. That
    ordering is deliberate and pinned by a row, not an accident of placement: this
    refusal is the cheapest to produce and the most actionable of the set, and every
    refusal it displaces is reachable again on the retry after the repair.
    Reproducing those checks here would mean spawning git from a probe, which is why
    they are not. At the `cmd_resolve` call site the displacement set is larger,
    because the gate sits at the end of that command's pre-side-effect block: it
    also precedes `policy_mod.load` and the whole `--restore-patch` validation, so
    an operator who passes a bad patch path AND holds an undecodable ledger is told
    about the ledger and only learns about the path on the retry. Same rationale —
    the ledger blocks the gesture outright, while the patch path is only reportable
    once the gesture can run at all.

    One definition backs both halves because they must not disagree: the root
    `task_spec_path` resolves against and the `confine_root` the writers validate the
    result against are the same claim about which tree owns this spec. Passing
    `state.project` while resolving against the worktree does not REFUSE the mismatch —
    `set_frontmatter_status`, `devcontract.strip_auto_run_result` and
    `verify.set_frontmatter_field` all answer an out-of-root path by silently dropping
    to the plain no-follow write, losing the confined arm's O_NOFOLLOW walk of the
    parent components (#593) with no signal at all.

    Worktrees normally resolve under `<project>/.bmad-loop/runs/...`, so the confined
    arm is taken by construction rather than by luck — no policy or env var can
    relocate them. The one escape is that `workspace.open_unit_workspace` stores a
    `.resolve()`d path: a symlinked `.bmad-loop`, `runs` or `worktrees` lands the spec
    outside `project`, and before this anchor moved that silently degraded all three
    writes.

    A worktree that CANNOT confine the anchored path yields the project instead. An
    absolute `spec_file` beside a set `worktree_path` is precisely the out-of-mount
    shape: `model._serialized_worktree_path` keeps a path verbatim exactly when
    `relative_to(worktree_path)` raises, so the two spellings did not share a prefix.
    Returning the worktree there would name a root that can never contain the path
    `task_spec_path` passes through — all FOUR writers of these bytes would silently take
    the plain no-follow arm and lose #593's O_NOFOLLOW walk.

    The project can often confine it. Where nothing can, every writer of these bytes
    lands on the arm it already took — they all select LEXICALLY, so an out-of-root path
    simply takes the plain no-follow write as before. That parity is load-bearing and was
    once broken: `_restore_rearmed_spec` called `atomic_write_bytes_confined` DIRECTLY
    with no lexical arm, so for a spec outside both the mount and the project — the shared
    artifact dir `_spec_is_shared_with_the_redrive` treats as first-class and reachable —
    the flip, the strip and the re-stamp all LANDED while the re-arm's undo alone raised
    `UnconfinedWriteError`, losing the rollback on precisely the specs it could still
    break. A writer that refuses where its siblings write does not add safety here; it
    subtracts the transaction. Do not re-introduce the asymmetry by "hardening" one of
    the four in isolation.

    The arm is not unconditionally an improvement either, and that exception is graded by
    `test_task_spec_root_refuses_a_spec_the_project_cannot_reach`: `_atomic_write_spec`
    picks its arm on a LEXICAL `is_relative_to`, but the confined arm it picks then
    walks the components below the root and refuses a redirect (`open_dir_confined` on
    POSIX, `path_is_confined` on win32). A spec that is lexically under the project but
    reached THROUGH a symlinked component — a symlinked `_bmad-output`, say — therefore
    moves from a succeeding plain no-follow write to `UnconfinedWriteError`, which
    `rearm_escalation` re-raises as `RearmError`. That is a re-arm which used to
    complete and now aborts, so this arm is not the pure improvement an earlier draft of
    this docstring claimed.

    It is kept anyway, because the alternative is worse. Predicting the walk here (gate
    the arm on `path_is_confined` and fall back to the worktree) makes the ROOT depend
    on filesystem state: `path_is_confined` answers False for a component it cannot
    probe, so a spec whose parent does not exist yet would anchor on the worktree and
    the same spec would anchor on the project once the directory appeared. A confine
    root that moves under a `mkdir` is not a definition. The refusal is also the correct
    posture on its own terms — #593 exists to refuse writes through a link on a path
    that came from a session-driven scan — so this trades a narrow, LOUD failure for a
    deterministic rule, and the failure names the path in its message.

    The test is the same lexical `is_relative_to` the writer gates on, so the root and
    the writer's ARM SELECTION agree by construction; only the walk below can still
    refuse. Deliberately not canonicalized: `_spec_is_shared_with_the_redrive` answers a
    DIFFERENT question (is this spec reachable by the re-drive) and canonicalizes for
    it, but matching that here would diverge from the gate this value is measured
    against and change writes that are correct today.

    shape `model._serialized_worktree_path` persists verbatim, reachable whenever a

    surface would then describe two trees, which is the exact defect the spec anchor

    So this mirrors `_stories_folder`'s own rule instead: the mount whenever the task

    terminal phase through successful integration keeps naming the unit worktree its
    teardown already removed. The `done_checkpoint` pause is raised in precisely that
    window, and the TUI reads this for the checkpoint card's title and description, so
    trusting the stale field lost the committed story's manifest to a deleted
    directory while the merged copy sat in the project checkout.

    Answering on filesystem state is right HERE and would be wrong in
    `task_spec_root`: that one is a write-confinement root, where a value that moves
    under a `mkdir` is not a definition. This is a READ locator, and observation
    degrades rather than raising — a probe that cannot answer falls back to the tree

    locator answering the recorded `state.project` after a project move reads the
    manifest from a tree the re-arm no longer writes: absent once the old tree is
    gone, stale while it lingers.

    The mount is probed on its REBASED spelling FIRST, and that ordering is the whole
    content of this function. `RUNS_DIR` is ``.bmad-loop/runs``, so a mount is spelled
    ``<project>/.bmad-loop/runs/<id>/worktrees/<unit>`` — INSIDE the recorded project,
    and it rebases like every other project-owned path. (Outside-the-project is only
    the symlinked-`.bmad-loop` layout `_spec_is_shared_with_the_redrive` names.) But
    `task_stories_root` decides on an existence probe against the RECORDED spelling,
    which after a project move names a directory that is gone: the probe fails, the
    mount is discarded for the project fallback, and rebasing that fallback hands back
    the MAIN CHECKOUT — while `live_spec_path` (whose `task_spec_root` runs no
    existence probe) follows the rename onto the moved mount. One surface, two trees:
    exactly the defect the spec anchor exists to close. Asking the live mount first
    keeps the isolated arm on the moved worktree, and a mount that is genuinely gone
    still degrades through `task_stories_root` to the project, rebased.

    `is_dir` degrades on OSError rather than raising, for `task_stories_root`'s own
    reason: this is a READ locator, and a probe that cannot answer falls back to the
    tree that always exists.

    """True when the recorded spec lives outside BOTH checkouts, so the re-arm's status
    flip survives a mount's disposal and the ISOLATED re-drive reads it.

    Asked only of a re-drive that will mount (`spec_reaches_the_redrive`'s isolated
    arm), and deliberately not of a task that HAS a mount: those are two different
    questions, and a policy flip separates them. A run switched from `isolation = "none"`
    to `"worktree"` while an escalation is paused re-drives isolated with no mount
    recorded at all, and the recorded spec is then measured against the project alone —
    which is the whole point, since the fresh worktree is cut from git and reads no
    working tree.

    The case: artifact dirs configured outside the project tree. `ProjectPaths.rebased`
    leaves those exactly where they are ("configured outside the project tree; doesn't
    move") — they are SHARED across checkouts, not per-worktree — so the spec the dev
    session reported resolves to one file that every worktree sees. The re-drive reads it
    back through `verify.resolve_spec_path`, whose absolute branch passes the value
    through untouched, and `engine._dispatched_spec_for_attempt` then accepts it because
    the rebased `implementation_artifacts` is still that same external directory.

    Both roots are load-bearing, and neither implies the other:

    - INSIDE the worktree — the file the fresh mount destroys. Unreachable.
    - inside the PROJECT but outside the worktree — the main checkout's copy. The write
      lands, but the re-drive cannot use it: under isolation `workspace.paths` is rebased
      onto the fresh worktree, so `verify.spec_within_roots` measures the main
      checkout's path against worktree-local roots and rejects it. Unreachable, and this
      is the one shape the worktree test alone would wrongly exempt.
    - outside both — the shared artifact dir above. Reachable.

    (The two are not nested: worktrees normally sit under `<project>/.bmad-loop/runs/`,
    but `workspace.open_unit_workspace` stores a `.resolve()`d path, so a symlinked
    `.bmad-loop` puts the mount outside the project.)

    The recorded spelling opens the question but does not answer it.
    `StoryTask._serialized_worktree_path` persists a spec RELATIVE whenever it sits under
    the mounted worktree (and, with no mount, whenever the run recorded it relative to
    the project), and verbatim (absolute) otherwise — so an absolute value is the only
    shape that can be shared. But that relativize is a LEXICAL `relative_to` against the
    same `worktree_path` read here, so all an absolute value proves is that the two
    spellings did not share a prefix. A spec reported through a symlink or a `..` segment
    sits inside the worktree and is persisted absolute all the same, and answering
    "shared" for it would suppress the warning on a spec that really is destroyed with
    the worktree.

    So containment is decided on the CANONICAL paths, and a host that cannot canonicalize
    one of them answers "not shared". That degrade is the safe direction and the reason
    this does not use `resolve_or_lexical`: its fallback is `absolute()`, which does not
    fold `..`, so a spec spelled through either checkout would come back looking external
    and go silent — trading a wrong warning for no warning at all."""

    checkout's working ref. `engine._finish_inflight` discards the escalated worktree
    and its branch and `_run_story` mounts a replacement, and
    `workspace.open_unit_workspace` cuts that fresh branch from the `base` it is handed
    — `worktree_flow.run_isolated` passes `state.target_branch`, pinned once at run
    start so resume keeps targeting the same branch. An operator who checks out another
    branch in the main checkout while the escalation is paused therefore moves `HEAD`
    off the tree the re-drive reads, in either direction: a correction committed on the
    now-current branch is invisible to the re-drive, and one committed on the target
    branch is invisible to `HEAD`.

    That mattered once `rearm-spec-write-unreachable` began holding the resume
    (`rearm_holds_the_resume`): reading the wrong ref does not merely mis-word a
    warning, it either resumes a re-drive that re-wedges on the target branch's
    terminal status, or holds a resume whose work is already committed where the
    re-drive will find it.

    `isolated_redrive` is the LIVE policy's isolation mode, injected by the caller, and
    the task drops out of the signature entirely. It used to be inferred from
    `task.worktree_path` — a recorded mount — and that is the retrospective fact, not
    this one. `engine._run_story` selects on `self._isolated` OR a recorded mount, but a
    re-drive never reaches it still carrying one: the restart arm releases the mount
    first — `_discard_unit_for_restart` while policy is still isolated,
    `_release_orphaned_mount` once it is not — so the mode a re-drive runs in is live
    policy's. An isolation change mid-run is journalled, never refused, so the recorded
    mount and the next re-drive part company in BOTH directions: a run flipped to
    `"none"` still carries the escalated attempt's mount and would name the pinned
    branch for an in-place re-drive that reads `HEAD`, and one flipped to
    `"worktree"` carries no
    mount at all and would name `HEAD` for a re-drive that mounts. Both send a
    correction to a tree the run does not read. The same injection is how
    `validate_restore_latch` already learns this fact.

    That the caller must supply it is the point: `bmad-loop resolve` computes this
    context in a SEPARATE process, before the resume ever runs, so no amount of
    resume-time bookkeeping on `task.worktree_path` could have reached it. The fact
    enters the pure core as a parameter and nothing here reads policy.

    An empty `target_branch` beside an isolated re-drive is a MISSING value, not a
    divergent one: `ensure_target_branch` pins the field before any worktree mounts, so
    only a state.json predating it can reach here, and that shape degrades to exactly
    the ref it read before — the same migration `restamp_code_root` gives an unrecorded
    root. Answering ``""`` instead would hold the resume on a per-configuration

    fixed-slug pre-planning-halt SENTINEL. A sentinel is cleared by DELETION, so the
    re-arm drops `task.spec_file` and there is no spec write whose reachability that
    helper could measure — which is why its arm is an `else` this path never entered,
    and why no hold ever fired for a sentinel. But the correction that stops the
    sentinel RECURRING is upstream, in the artifacts `bmad-loop-resolve/SKILL.md` sends
    the agent to instead of the sentinel, and it faces the identical gap: an isolated
    re-drive mounts fresh from `redrive_base_ref` and re-plans from a COMMITTED tree, so
    an uncommitted upstream edit is invisible and the re-plan mints the sentinel again.

    The two arms are NOT the spec question's, and the difference is where the write
    lands. `task_spec_path` re-anchors a spec write ON the recorded mount, so a policy
    flip separates writer from reader in BOTH directions. The upstream artifacts are
    named by a project-relative `state.spec_folder` and `resolve.run_session` runs the
    agent with `cwd=project`, so the correction lands in the MAIN CHECKOUT whichever way
    the flip went. That collapses one arm:

    - the re-drive runs IN PLACE: it reads the main checkout's working tree —
      `stories_engine._stories_folder` anchors a relative folder on the live workspace
      root, which is the project under `isolation = "none"`. Writer and reader are the
      same tree, so the edit reaches. The recorded mount does not enter into it; a run
      flipped `"worktree" -> "none"` mid-pause still carries one, and it is not where
      the correction went.
    - the re-drive will MOUNT: the fresh worktree is cut from git and checks out TRACKED
      files, so no working-tree write reaches it — with the single exception
      `_spec_is_shared_with_the_redrive` carries in full, an artifact dir configured
      OUTSIDE the project tree, which `ProjectPaths.rebased` leaves exactly where it is
      and every worktree therefore reads through the same absolute path. True whether or
      not a mount is recorded: a run flipped `"none" -> "worktree"` has none, and its
      working-tree edit vanishes just as silently.

    Both roots are tested on the mounting arm for the same reason that helper tests
    both: worktrees normally sit under `<project>/.bmad-loop/runs/`, but
    `workspace.open_unit_workspace` stores a `.resolve()`d path, so a symlinked
    `.bmad-loop` puts the mount outside the project and "outside the project" alone
    would not be "shared".

    Canonicalized because a `..` segment or a symlinked component puts a
    physically-inside path outside lexically, and a host that cannot canonicalize

    `_redrive_spec_status`'s counterpart for the sentinel path, and it exists for the
    same reason: without it the record its caller writes is a per-configuration
    CONSTANT. Every isolated stories run resolves its spec folder inside the project,
    so `stories_reach_the_redrive` answers "unreachable" for 100% of sentinel re-arms

    two-command gesture for an outcome nothing decided. That is the exact failure the
    spec arm's own narrowing exists to avoid, and it is worse here.

    There is no status to read for a sentinel — it is cleared by deletion and the
    re-plan routes on nothing — so the proof is byte equality instead: if the ref the
    fresh worktree is cut from already holds what this checkout holds, the re-drive
    re-plans from exactly the tree the operator is looking at and there is nothing left
    to commit. If it does not, the operator has upstream work the re-drive will not read.

    Read at `redrive_base_ref` and NOT at the code root's `HEAD`, for the reason that
    function documents: an operator who checks out another branch while the escalation
    is paused moves `HEAD` off the tree the re-drive reads, in either direction. It is
    asked for the MOUNTING mode unconditionally, and takes no `isolated_redrive` to say
    so, because there is exactly one reachable caller and it has already established
    that: `stories_reach_the_redrive` answers "reaches" for every in-place re-drive, so
    the `and` short-circuits before this runs. Carrying a second in-place arm here would
    not be defence in depth — it would SHADOW that one, leaving the reachability arm
    ungraded by any test and a wrong answer there invisible.

    Every uncertainty answers ``False`` so the record fires and the resume holds: a
    folder outside the code root (which includes the external artifact dir, already
    exempted one gate earlier as SHARED), an unreadable working-tree file, an untracked
    or non-blob path at that ref (the read answers ``None``, which no byte string
    equals), or any `GitError` — including the project simply not being a repository. Suppression requires proof that the work is already done.

    The blob is materialized through `worktree_file_bytes_at_revision`, not read raw:
    that function exists for precisely this comparison — a live checkout file against
    its committed counterpart — because Git's smudge, EOL and working-tree-encoding
    filters mean a byte-exact LF blob is legitimately a CRLF file on disk under
    `core.autocrlf=true`. Comparing raw blob bytes would mismatch every artifact on a

    the file and re-run resolve. That used to be earned twice over — by SEQUENCING for
    the two refusals that raise before `devcontract.strip_auto_run_result` runs (which is
    why that strip is still deliberately ordered after the flip's read-back check), and
    by two hand-placed calls to this function for the two that could not be sequenced out
    of the hazard. Neither half covered the rest of the window: a `journal.append`
    OSError from the residue pass, a non-Git fault from the commits probe, or a failing
    `save_state` each escaped with the flip published and the task still ESCALATED.

    So there is now ONE caller, `_rollback_rearm`, invoked from the transaction guard
    that spans the whole window from the first spec write to `save_state`. The sequencing
    is not redundant — it is what keeps those two refusals from ever writing in the first
    place — but the undo no longer depends on someone remembering to place it.

    THREE outcomes rather than a bool, because the operator surfaces make a CLAIM about
    the file and only one of the non-restoring cases entitles them to it:

    * ``"restored"`` — a write had landed and was put back.
    * ``"unchanged"`` — the file was READ and PROVED byte-equal to `original`, so nothing
      landed, nothing is rewritten, and the mtime is left alone. This is the only answer
      that licenses "the spec was left exactly as the re-arm found it".
    * ``"unknown"`` — this undo cannot say. Two shapes reach it. `original` is `None`,
      meaning the spec was unreadable at capture time or the re-arm never entered the
      spec block at all (the sentinel-clear leg, which has already UNLINKED the file —
      so a reader told "unchanged" there would be told a deleted file proves the tree is
      untouched). Or the spec is gone or unreadable NOW, in which case the undo could not
      even look: recreating a file another process removed would fight a concurrent actor
      rather than restore this function's own edit, so it declines — but declining is not
      the same as proving nothing landed.

    Folding those into one "nothing had to be put back" answer is what made the notice
    overclaim, so the distinction lives in the return type rather than in a comment.

    Byte-verbatim, never the text writer: `atomic_write_text_confined` would re-encode and
    translate newlines, so a CRLF spec would come back subtly different from the file this
    re-arm found.

    And it picks its arm the SAME LEXICAL WAY the three writers it undoes do
    (`frontmatter.set_frontmatter_status` states the rule; `verify.set_frontmatter_field`
    and `devcontract._atomic_write_spec` restate it): under `confine_root`, through the
    component-walking confined helper (#593); outside it, the plain `follow_symlinks=False`
    write.

    `confine_root` is the LIVE root — `live_spec_root(task, state, live_project)`, which
    is `task_spec_root` REBASED onto the tree this gesture is acting in — and `live_project`
    is a required parameter for that reason rather than an optional one falling back to
    `task_spec_root`. The three forward writers this undoes all confine against the live
    root (`rearm_escalation` passes `live_spec_root(task, state, live_project)` to the flip,
    the strip and the baseline re-stamp), and `spec_path` is itself `live_spec_path`, so
    reading the RECORDED root here compared the live path against a root it need not sit
    under. After a project rename the two spellings diverge, the lexical
    `is_relative_to` goes False, and this undo silently dropped to the plain arm on
    exactly the specs its own siblings had just written through the CONFINED one — losing
    #593's O_NOFOLLOW walk of the parent components with no signal, since
    `follow_symlinks=False` guards only the FINAL component. The observable outcome is
    otherwise identical (right file, right bytes, `rollback="restored"`), which is why
    nothing downstream could catch it and why the parity is asserted at this seam. The
    arm-selection RULE above is unchanged; only the root it compares against is corrected.

    Calling the confined helper unconditionally looked stricter and was strictly
    worse — an artifacts folder configured OUTSIDE both the mount and the project is
    supported configuration (`bmadconfig` resolves one, `verify.spec_within_roots` trusts
    it, `_spec_is_shared_with_the_redrive` treats it as first-class), and there the flip,
    the strip and the re-stamp all LAND while this undo alone raised
    `UnconfinedWriteError`. The undo then reported `failed` on exactly the specs it was
    able to break, which is the asymmetry `task_spec_root`'s docstring used to name as
    out of scope. A restore that refuses where the writes succeeded is not extra safety;
    it is the transaction's write set going unhonoured.

    A restore that itself fails RAISES rather than degrading — the spec is then
    half-written and only the operator can settle it, which is the loudest thing this can
    be. `UnconfinedWriteError` is an `OSError`, so the one arm still covers both.

    `unknown` is reserved for the two shapes that are ANSWERS rather than failures to
    look: nothing was captured, and the spec is gone. A read that merely could not be
    performed is neither, and must not short-circuit the undo — see the `except` arms.

    The error-path half of `rearm_escalation`'s transaction. Its caller re-raises the
    original fault immediately after, so nothing here may return a verdict or swallow
    one: this function's whole job is to leave the spec's bytes as the re-arm found them
    and put the fact on the run's audit trail.

    `live_project` is threaded straight through to `_restore_rearmed_spec`, which confines
    against the LIVE (rebased) spec root so the undo validates its write with the same
    root the forward writers used. The guard's caller already holds it, so this parameter
    carries the fact rather than re-deriving it — see `_restore_rearmed_spec` for what
    re-deriving it from `task_spec_root` silently cost after a project rename.

    `rollback` goes ON the record, not left to be re-derived, because every reader is
    OUT of process: `rearm_event_notice` renders from a journal line alone, with neither
    the task nor the tree to consult, and the outcomes need different sentences.
    `restored` and `unchanged` are `_restore_rearmed_spec`'s own answers and both mean
    the spec on disk is what the re-arm found. `failed` means the restore itself could
    not write, the one outcome that can leave a HALF-WRITTEN spec — recorded from a
    `finally` for exactly that reason, since that arm re-raises. `unknown` means no such
    claim is available: either this re-arm never resolved a spec path at all, or the undo
    could not read the file to prove anything.

    The sentinel-clear leg lands in `unknown` and that is the point. It runs INSIDE the
    guarded window but writes no spec bytes — it UNLINKS the sentinel — and the
    transaction deliberately does not undo it (`_clear_sentinel` preserves a copy under
    `{run_dir}/sentinels/` and a retried resolve re-clears it idempotently). What the
    transaction covers is the spec's BYTES from the first spec write onward; the deletion
    is outside that, so the record must not claim the tree is as the re-arm found it.

    The record is journalled through a `finally` and every `Exception` from that append
    is suppressed. Recording an abort is an OBSERVATION, and an observation that cannot
    be made must not replace the fault the operator is being told about — while a restore
    failure is a repair write, and repair writes raise.

    `Exception` and not `OSError`, which is the ONE place in this transaction where the
    breadth is deliberately NARROWER than the guard's own `BaseException` and, at the
    same time, wider than a filesystem taxonomy. Wider, because `Journal.append`
    serializes caller-supplied values and opens a file: a `TypeError` or `ValueError` out
    of `json.dumps`, or anything else this append can raise, would otherwise REPLACE the
    fault the whole record exists to report — the `Always:` re-raise invariant the two
    pinned `MemoryError` tests depend on. Narrower, because `KeyboardInterrupt` and
    `SystemExit` must still leave: by the time this `finally` runs the rollback has
    already completed, so an interrupt here cannot reproduce DW-79/DW-83, and discarding
    the operator's Ctrl-C to keep a breadcrumb would be the worse trade.

    `journal.save_state` ends in `atomic_replace`, so the commit is a single rename that
    either happened or did not — but the CALL can still fail after it: a `KeyboardInterrupt`
    delivered between that rename and the return unwinds through the transaction guard
    with `state.json` already describing a PENDING, re-armed task. Rolling the spec back
    there does not restore the pre-re-arm world; it MANUFACTURES the mirror image of
    DW-79/DW-83 — persisted state re-armed against a spec that is not — and then reports
    it as "nothing was persisted, the story is still escalated", which is simply false.

    The guard cannot know this from control flow (no assignment after `save_state` runs
    on that path), so it ASKS THE DISK, which is the only witness of a rename. Both the
    bumped `generation` and the reset `phase` must match the object `save_state` was
    handed: `generation` alone would be satisfied by a state file this call never wrote
    only if some other writer had minted the same bump, and `phase` alone moves for
    reasons a re-arm does not own.

    Those two conjuncts are a sufficient identity because the entire re-arm — including
    this error-path probe — runs inside :func:`journal.state_lock`. Every state writer
    participates through the self-locking :func:`journal.save_state`, and every external
    read-modify-write gesture holds the same canonical run sidecar from its deciding read
    through publication. Therefore no rival can supply the observed generation/phase
    while this transaction is in flight: a waiter reloads only after this hold exits.

    The two operator call sites still repeat liveness under their outer transaction
    holds. That is a separate safety rule: serialization prevents stale publication,
    while liveness prevents deliberately taking a turn after an engine known to be live.
    The portability guard keeps both the writer/transaction inventory and the two re-arm
    surface gates executable rather than relying on this prose.

    Degrades to `False` — roll back, the pre-existing behavior — on ANY failure to read
    or parse the state file. This is observation feeding a repair decision, and the safe
    default is the one that leaves the spec as the re-arm found it: a re-arm that did
    NOT commit and is wrongly believed to have is the DW-79/DW-83 defect itself, while
    the converse leaves a rolled-back spec beside committed state that the next resume
    re-drives from a spec still carrying the escalated status — recoverable, and loud.

    ANY failure means `BaseException`, and that breadth is the whole reason this probe is
    safe to call where it is called. Its ONE call site sits inside the transaction guard's
    `except BaseException` arm and runs BEFORE `_rollback_rearm`, so a fault escaping this
    function escapes the guard too and the rollback never happens — leaving exactly the
    spec-flipped-against-an-ESCALATED-task state the guard exists to end, now reached by
    the code added to prevent its mirror image. `load_state` reads and parses a file, so a
    `KeyboardInterrupt` or `SystemExit` delivered anywhere in it is not hypothetical, and
    under `except Exception` it took precisely that path.

    Swallowing an interrupt here is therefore the correct trade, and it is not a lost
    Ctrl-C: the rollback is a REPAIR WRITE that must not be skipped, and the guard's own
    `raise` still propagates the original re-arm fault immediately afterwards, so the
    process still exits loudly — one spec-sized write later. This is the reverse of the
    trade `_rollback_rearm`'s abort-record append makes, and the two are consistent
    because the acts differ: recording is an observation and must never displace a fault,
    while repairing is a write whose omission IS the defect. The abort record's append
    remains the ONE place in this transaction whose breadth is narrower than the guard's.

    No `rearm-aborted` record is written on the committed path either (the caller skips
    the whole rollback). Every rendering of that kind asserts that nothing was persisted;
    there is no value of `rollback` that is true here, and inventing one would put a
    false sentence on both operator surfaces rather than leave the fault to speak.

    The proof that decides whether the operator still has anything to do, so it has to
    read the same file the caller's remedy names — otherwise the record holds a resume
    over work that is already done, or clears on work that is not.

    Two sources, because the two re-drive modes read two different things:

    * MOUNTING: the fresh worktree is cut from git and checks out TRACKED files only, so
      it reads the COMMITTED spec and never a working-tree write. Anchored on
      `state.code_root` — the same tree the baseline advance reads — at the ref
      `redrive_base_ref` names, the run's pinned `target_branch` rather than that tree's
      current `HEAD`.
    * IN PLACE: the story re-runs in the main checkout, which reads its WORKING TREE. A
      commit is neither required nor sufficient there, so measuring the committed tree
      would hold the resume until the operator committed a correction the re-drive would
      have read uncommitted — and `rearm_event_notice`'s in-place remedy tells them to
      do exactly that (re-apply it in the main checkout, no commit), so a committed-only
      proof would make the record's own instruction unable to clear it.

    Reached only when the write does NOT reach the re-drive, so the in-place arm is
    always the isolation-flip shape: the flip's write landed in the mount the escalated
    attempt recorded while the re-drive reads `state.project`. That is the tree
    `task_spec_root` answers for a task with no mount, which is what the resume makes
    this task once `release_mount_owned_state` runs.

    Degrades to ``""`` on every uncertainty: a spec recorded absolute (nothing names
    its position in the tree), an absent or non-blob path at that ref, a non-UTF-8 blob,
    or any `GitError` — which includes the project simply not being a repository, and a
    `target_branch` the code root no longer carries. ``""`` never equals a target
    status, so the caller's record still fires. Suppression therefore requires PROOF
    that the work is already done, and the non-repo case stays non-fatal, as the story's
    Boundaries require.

    Degrades to ``""`` on every uncertainty in BOTH arms, including a spec recorded
    absolute. That arm is narrower than it looks: the caller has already answered the one
    absolute shape whose write the re-drive DOES read — the shared external spec — with
    `_spec_is_shared_with_the_redrive`. What still reaches here is an absolute spelling
    of a path inside one of the two checkouts, which is genuinely unreachable, and whose
    position in the re-drive's tree nothing here can name, so degrading it to a warning
    is the right answer rather than a gap.

    """Re-arm an escalation-paused story so the next resume re-drives it.

    Flips the escalated task out of its terminal ESCALATED phase back to
    PENDING — which makes `_finish_inflight` reset the tree to the story's
    baseline and re-run it (clean rebuild) against the now-corrected frozen
    spec. The baseline itself is advanced to the CODE TREE's current HEAD
    (`state.code_root`, which is `paths.repo_root` — the tree the dev writer
    stamps from and the proof-of-work gate measures, and the same directory as
    `state.project` in every configuration without a `repo_root:` override) and
    the untracked snapshot refreshed, so commits and files the resolve session
    produced count as the rebuild's starting point, not as attempt debris to
    roll back. Strips the escalated attempt's stale `## Auto Run Result`
    section so the re-drive cannot read as terminal from its first save, and
    sets the spec's frontmatter status so step-01 routes to the right stage.
    Does NOT clear the pause; the caller resumes the run separately.

    Two consequences of the reset are load-bearing and easy to undo by accident:

    - `task.generation` is bumped, because `attempt` returning to 0 would
      otherwise let the re-drive re-mint a session id byte-equal to one the
      abandoned attempt already recorded (#705). `task.sessions` is deliberately
      NOT cleared — a second resolve cycle reads that run-dir audit trail — so
      the id is what has to change. That preserved trail is also what
      `resolution_recorded` watermarks: keeping it whole is what lets a later
      cycle tell the answered prefix from the unanswered tail, instead of
      choosing between re-presenting everything and losing the audit (DW-11).
    - The spec's `baseline_revision` is re-stamped on BOTH legs, and only when the
      advance above actually RAN — `advanced` records that both git reads succeeded,
      not that HEAD changed, so a resolve session that committed nothing still
      re-stamps (with the same sha, harmlessly). What it will not do is re-stamp
      after a FAILED advance (see the block that does it for why each half of that
      is the way it is).

    Two re-drive modes, selected by `restore_patch`:

    - **from-scratch** (default, ``restore_patch=None``): status → ``ready-for-dev``
      so the dev session re-implements from a clean baseline. Assigning None also
      clears any stale latch from a prior restore attempt the human abandoned.
    - **patch-restore** (BMAD-METHOD #2564, ``restore_patch`` set): the human
      confirmed the escalated attempt's reading was correct. Status → ``in-review``
      so step-01 routes straight to step-04, and the path is latched onto the task
      (`task.restore_patch`) so the engine re-applies the saved patch onto the
      baseline before dispatching — the re-driven session resumes review on the
      restored diff instead of re-implementing. The status is set here
      deterministically; the resolve agent must NOT set it. Because the baseline
      advances (above) while the patch was diffed from the OLD baseline, a resolve
      session that committed changes to the patched files makes the re-drive's
      apply fail — the engine then escalates loudly instead of dispatching on a
      half-restored tree (see verify.apply_patch).

    Stories mode: when the escalated spec is a fixed-slug sentinel
    (`<id>-unresolved.md` / `<id>-ambiguous.md`, written by a pre-planning HALT),
    it cannot be re-opened by a status flip — its very presence wedges the id.
    Instead preserve a copy under `{run_dir}/sentinels/`, journal `sentinel-cleared`
    with the blocking condition, and delete it, so the re-dispatch resolves to a
    clean PENDING and re-plans from scratch (leg 1 again for a spec_checkpoint id).

    `isolated_redrive` is the LIVE policy's isolation mode (`scm.isolation ==
    "worktree"`), which run state cannot carry: the mode is re-read at every resume and
    a mid-run change is journalled, never refused, so the recorded `task.worktree_path`
    says how the escalated attempt RAN and only policy says how the re-drive WILL run.
    Keyword-only and required, because every consumer of it here is an answer a human
    acts on — which ref to commit the corrected spec on, whether the working-tree flip
    reaches the re-drive at all, whether a restore latch can be honored — and a
    defaulted mode would answer all three for the wrong tree in silence, which is the
    defect this parameter exists to close. Both callers (`cli.cmd_resolve`,
    `tui.TuiApp._do_rearm`) hold a loaded policy already.

    `resolution_recorded` says whether THIS gesture accepted a resolution, and it
    alone gates the `escalations_resolved_upto` watermark (DW-11): the next resolve
    cycle hides every escalation recorded below it, so advancing it over entries no
    human answered would bury them forever and report them as already answered — the
    inverse of the defect the watermark exists to fix. Keyword-only and REQUIRED for
    the same reason as `isolated_redrive`: a default would be wrong in silence on
    exactly the path that matters. It is a PARAMETER rather than a disk read because
    the fact is not on disk. `resolution.json` is unlinked at one site in `src/`
    (`resolve.run_session`, before it launches), which only `cli.cmd_resolve`'s
    interactive arm reaches, and nothing deletes the marker at or after a re-arm — so
    the marker survives the re-arm that consumed it, and `resolve --no-interactive` or
    the TUI's Re-arm button would read the PREVIOUS cycle's marker as its own. The
    caller already holds the answer: `cmd_resolve` binds it from `resolve.run_session`,
    and both non-interactive callers know by construction that no session ran. Do not
    unlink the marker here either — the TUI's Re-arm button is gated on its presence.

    `project_root` is the LIVE CLI project, and it exists so this function writes the
    file `resolve.build_context` told the agent to edit. `state.project` is the
    LAUNCH-TIME project and nothing re-stamps it (unlike `state.code_root`, which
    `restamp_code_root` re-points just before both callers reach here), so after a
    project move `task_spec_path` resolves under a directory that no longer exists:
    the status flip and the baseline re-stamp both silently no-op — every writer
    answers an absent path with `False` rather than an exception — while the agent's
    correction sits in the live tree the re-drive actually reads. The re-drive then
    wedges on the escalated attempt's status and the escalation is spent.
    `build_context` already rebases the `spec_file` it publishes, through the very
    helper used here, so the two sides now name one file.

    `None` means "the project this run recorded", which is byte-for-byte today's
    behavior and the correct answer for every run whose project has not moved — the
    default is safe in a way `isolated_redrive`'s would not be, because it does not
    stand in for a fact only the caller holds; it names the same tree the caller
    would pass. It is optional for that reason and to match `build_context`'s own
    signature, which takes the live roots the same way.

    Scope is the WRITE TARGET and its confinement root, not the reachability verdicts
    beside them. Those read `task.spec_file`, which is relative for every run that
    records one under the project, and answer without consulting `state.project` at
    all; the two that can consult it degrade toward WARNING on an unresolvable path,
    which is the safe direction and already their documented contract.

    The generation bump stays UNCONDITIONAL beside the gated stamp: it answers session-id
    reuse (#705), which an abandoned attempt needs exactly as much as a resolved one.

    Returns the authoritative re-arm outcome: the story key, the ordered notices
    whose journal appends succeeded during this call, and whether one of the appended
    records holds the combined re-arm/resume gesture. Raises RearmError when the run is not paused at
    the escalation stage, the target story is not escalated, or a supplied
    `restore_patch` fails `validate_restore_latch` (the shared precondition set —
    sentinel wedge, spec-less escalation, worktree isolation).

def rearm_holds_the_resume(entry: dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
    """True for a re-arm record whose remedy has to land BEFORE the re-drive reads the
    tree — so a surface that re-arms and resumes in ONE gesture must stop after the
    re-arm and leave `bmad-loop resume` to the operator.

    THREE records qualify, and the discriminator is PROOF, not urgency. Two of them
    qualify by KIND; the third qualifies by its FLAGS, because one kind there covers
    outcomes that answer this question differently.
    `rearm-spec-write-unreachable` is written only once `_redrive_spec_status` has
    established that the committed spec does NOT carry the status the re-drive routes
    on, and only for a spec the working-tree flip cannot reach. Resuming on it is not
    risky, it is futile: the re-drive discards the worktree, mounts a fresh one from
    git, and step-01 reads a status it cannot route — `unrecognized status in existing
    story file` halts it blocked, and the escalation is spent. The record's own
    next_step already said "commit the corrected spec ... before resuming"; both
    default surfaces then resumed in the same breath, which made the imperative
    unactionable at the moment it rendered. It names the target `status:` as well as
    the branch, because a spec committed there still carrying the escalated attempt's
    terminal status re-wedges exactly as an uncommitted one does. The interactive resolve agent cannot close that gap either
    — its skill forbids it from committing.

    `rearm-upstream-write-unreachable` earns it the same way on the sentinel path,
    where there is no spec write to measure at all: the sentinel is cleared by
    deletion, and the correction that stops it recurring sits upstream in `SPEC.md` /
    `stories.yaml`. Its proof is `_redrive_reads_the_upstream_artifacts`, which fires
    the record only while the ref the re-drive mounts from does NOT already hold this
    checkout's copy of those two files — so, exactly as above, resuming is not risky
    but futile: the re-drive re-plans from a tree that never saw the correction and
    mints the same sentinel again.

    The other warnings stay advisory and do NOT hold — `stale-restore-commits`,
    `stale-restore-unparseable`, `rearm-commits-probe-failed` and
    `rearm-baseline-advance-failed` among them: each reports something an operator may
    need to act on, but none of them PROVES the re-drive cannot route, and holding on a
    maybe would turn the ordinary degrade path into a two-command gesture for an
    outcome nothing decided. `rearm-commits-probe-failed` is the newest and the least
    tempting to promote: it says the commits probe could not answer, which is strictly
    LESS than the answer — it proves nothing about whether the re-drive can route, only
    that one advisory could not be computed.

    `rearm-spec-flip-skipped` earns it on ONE of its three arms, which is why this is
    keyed on the record's flags rather than on the bare kind. Its producer writes
    `refused = spec_path.is_file() and write_reaches_the_redrive`, so
    `reaches_redrive and not refused` isolates exactly the leg where the flip addressed
    the copy the re-drive reads and that path is NOT a readable file here — so the
    re-drive reads the same path and finds no spec there to route on. Futile, on the
    same proof as the two above, and that arm's next_step says "restore the recorded
    spec path ... before resuming"; without this it rendered on surfaces that resumed
    in the same gesture, which is the defect the two kinds above were fixed for. The
    remedy names the target `status:` too: a file put back at that path still carrying
    the escalated attempt's terminal status is unroutable for the same reason a missing
    one is. The other two arms must NOT hold: the `refused` arm raises `RearmError` from
    the producer, so no resume happens at all and holding would be meaningless, and the
    remaining arm carries no next_step because the imperative on that leg belongs to
    `rearm-spec-write-unreachable`, which holds the resume itself.

    Not folded into `rearm_event_notice`'s tuple, because they are different questions
    asked of the same entry: that table answers "what do I tell the operator", this
    answers "may this gesture still resume". Both surfaces ask both, in one walk.

    re-drive's own reset already reverts the patch's tracked hunks, an `apply -R`
    fails outright on any drift the resolve session introduced, and it misbehaves
    on the committed variant below. Only the patch's new files are durable
    contamination, and naming them is enough — `verify.safe_rollback` deletes
    whatever the refreshed snapshot stops blessing.

    Also journals (warn-only) the commits sitting between the OLD baseline and the

    re-drive's permanent starting point, and no reset revisits it. It is not

    human is the classifier. `bmad-loop resolve` echoes these to stderr.
