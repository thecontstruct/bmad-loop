    Flips the escalated task out of its terminal ESCALATED phase back to
    PENDING — which makes `_finish_inflight` reset the tree to the story's
    baseline and re-run it (clean rebuild) against the now-corrected frozen
    spec. The baseline itself is advanced to the project's current HEAD (and
    the untracked snapshot refreshed) so commits and files the resolve session
    produced count as the rebuild's starting point, not as attempt debris to
    roll back. Strips the escalated attempt's stale `## Auto Run Result`
    section so the re-drive cannot read as terminal from its first save, and
    sets the spec's frontmatter status so step-01 routes to the right stage.
    Does NOT clear the pause; the caller resumes the run separately.

    Two re-drive modes, selected by `restore_patch`:

    - **from-scratch** (default, ``restore_patch=None``): status → ``ready-for-dev``
      so the dev session re-implements from a clean baseline. Assigning None also
      clears any stale latch from a prior restore attempt the human abandoned.
    - **patch-restore** (BMAD-METHOD #2564, ``restore_patch`` set): the human
      confirmed the escalated attempt's reading was correct. Status → ``in-review``
      so step-01 routes straight to step-04, and the path is latched onto the task
      (`task.restore_patch`) so the engine re-applies the saved patch onto the
      baseline before dispatching — the re-driven session resumes review on the
      restored diff instead of re-implementing. The status is set here
      deterministically; the resolve agent must NOT set it. Because the baseline
      advances (above) while the patch was diffed from the OLD baseline, a resolve
      session that committed changes to the patched files makes the re-drive's
      apply fail — the engine then escalates loudly instead of dispatching on a
      half-restored tree (see verify.apply_patch).

    Stories mode: when the escalated spec is a fixed-slug sentinel
    (`<id>-unresolved.md` / `<id>-ambiguous.md`, written by a pre-planning HALT),
    it cannot be re-opened by a status flip — its very presence wedges the id.
    Instead preserve a copy under `{run_dir}/sentinels/`, journal `sentinel-cleared`
    with the blocking condition, and delete it, so the re-dispatch resolves to a
    clean PENDING and re-plans from scratch (leg 1 again for a spec_checkpoint id).

    Returns the re-armed story key. Raises RearmError when the run is not paused at
    the escalation stage, the target story is not escalated, or a supplied
    `restore_patch` fails `validate_restore_latch` (the shared precondition set —

    fails outright on any drift the resolve session introduced, and it misbehaves
    on the committed variant below. Only the patch's new files are durable
    contamination, and naming them is enough — `verify.safe_rollback` deletes
    whatever the refreshed snapshot stops blessing.

    Also journals (warn-only) the commits sitting between the OLD baseline and the
    new one: a commit the escalated re-drive session made now becomes the next
    re-drive's permanent starting point, and no reset revisits it. It is not
    mechanically reversible — the resolve session's own blessed commits live in the
    same range and reverting those would claw back the human's resolution — so the
    human is the classifier. `bmad-loop resolve` echoes these to stderr.

    Best-effort throughout: a deleted or unreadable patch, a non-repo project, a
    bad old baseline — none may wedge a resolve. Every failure degrades to the
    pre-#90 behavior and says so in the journal.
