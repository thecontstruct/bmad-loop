    Measured causes: a `pre-merge-commit` or `commit-msg` hook exiting non-zero,
    and a `commit.gpgsign` that cannot produce a signature. Neither sibling's
    remedy fits — there is no content conflict to resolve and no target state to
    clear, only a policy or a key the operator's own repo configures — which is
    the whole reason this is a third type rather than either of theirs.

    Two legs reach it, through different commits. `--no-ff` is refused at the
    merge's own commit and leaves MERGE_HEAD, which is what parts it from a
    genuine pre-flight refusal — `merge_branch` reads that BEFORE its abort
    rather than only to decide whether to abort at all. (`_index_unmerged`
    cannot see this state: a merge that resolved cleanly leaves no unmerged
    stages whether or not the commit that would have sealed it was allowed.)
    The squash leg is refused at its OWN plain `git commit`, after
    `merge --squash` already staged the result — hooks and signing run there
    like anywhere else — so no MERGE_HEAD is involved and no classification is
    needed: the merge step succeeded, and the failed call identifies the state
    by itself.

    ``restored`` says whether the rollback that follows actually put the
    checkout back — `merge --abort` on the `--no-ff` leg, `reset --hard HEAD`
    on the squash leg (gated on the leg's pre-merge dirtiness snapshot: a
    checkout that already carried uncommitted work is never reset, #619). The
    squash rollback is deliberately whole-tree — it is undoing a SUCCEEDED
    merge whose staged result spans the entire incoming set — which leaves one
    stated ceiling: an operator edit landing after the pre-merge reading found
    the tree clean sits inside the reset's blast radius (see
    `_reset_hard_head`).
    It is an attribute rather than a type of its own because the operator's
    CAUSE is the same either way — a policy declined the commit — and only the first
    step of their remedy differs: a checkout left mid-merge has to be recovered
    before fixing that policy is worth anything, and a resume attempted before then
    fails again on the merge state rather than on the policy. A caller that ignores
    the flag still gets a true statement of the cause; one that reads it can order
    the two steps (#619).

    ``staged`` names WHERE an unrestored checkout stands, because the two legs
    strand differently and the operator's first step differs with them: False
    means mid-merge (MERGE_HEAD set, `git merge --abort` recovers it), True
    means the squash result is still sitting staged (`reset --hard HEAD` clears
    it — after their own uncommitted work, if that is what blocked the rollback,
    is stashed or committed). Always False when ``restored`` is True: a checkout
    that was put back holds nothing."""

class MergeHalfAppliedError(GitError):
    """Git died PART-WAY through checking the merge out: some incoming files are
    already sitting in the target checkout, and no restore removes them.

    A sibling of `MergePreflightError`, never a subclass, because it falsifies
    that class's central claim — the working tree was never touched. Measured
    cause (git 2.55.0, both `--no-ff` and `--squash`): a **required** clean/smudge
    filter that fails. git materializes the incoming paths in index order, so the
    ones sorting before the filtered path are written to the working tree and the
    ones after it are not; git then rolls the INDEX back and exits, leaving the
    written files behind as UNTRACKED. Nothing in the failure's own shape
    distinguishes it from a genuine pre-flight refusal: no unmerged stages, no
    MERGE_HEAD, and — because `git diff --quiet HEAD --` cannot see untracked
    files — a tree that reads clean against HEAD.

    That residue is why this is a type and not a message tweak. It blocks the
    NEXT merge as an untracked-overwrite pre-flight refusal, so a run told its
    checkout was unchanged fails the same way on every resume, over paths the
    error never named.

    The residue has TWO axes and they are not interchangeable. An incoming path
    the target did not already track lands as an untracked file, which no restore
    reaches. An incoming path it DID track is modified in place, which a
    path-scoped `git checkout HEAD --` over exactly the attributed paths does
    undo. So the tracked axis is repaired and the untracked axis is reported, and
    the class carries one field for each — plus ``rewritten``, naming the tracked
    paths the repair covered (or failed to).

    Attribution, on both axes, is a per-path AND of two proofs: the path changed
    during the merge window (a before/after delta, never an absolute reading) AND
    the merge could have written it (the branch's incoming set). Each proof rules
    out the misattribution the other cannot: the delta keeps the operator's
    pre-existing strays and edits out, the intersection keeps their CONCURRENT
    writes out — an edit landing on a bystander path mid-merge was once swept
    into a repo-wide "the tree is dirty now" reading and destroyed by the
    repo-wide reset riding on it. Two ceilings remain, per path: a path already
    dirty before the merge stays unattributable, and a concurrent write to a
    path INSIDE the incoming set is indistinguishable from git's and is restored
    with it.

    ``paths`` carries the untracked residue — what the operator still has to
    clear. Deliberately not cleaned: `reset --hard` and `merge --abort` both
    leave untracked files alone (measured), and deleting them is precisely the
    destruction #619's before-snapshot exists to prevent — the attribution
    proves git wrote *a* path, not that the bytes there are git's.

    ``rewritten`` carries the tracked residue — the paths whose restore
    ``restored`` reports on, so a failed repair can be finished by hand
    path-scoped (`git checkout HEAD -- <path>`) instead of by the repo-wide
    reset whose blast radius the attribution exists to avoid.

    ``restored`` says whether the TRACKED half was rolled back, and is True when
    there was none to roll back. It matters because it changes the operator's
    FIRST step, exactly as its namesake on `MergeCommitRefusedError` does: a
    checkout still holding incoming content on tracked paths refuses the next
    merge over those paths ("Your local changes would be overwritten"), so a resume
    attempted before restoring it fails on the tree rather than on whatever stopped
    the checkout.

    An empty ``paths`` with ``restored`` True is still this class and not
    `MergePreflightError`. The checkout ends up in the same place, but the CAUSE
    the operator has to act on is a different one — something stopped git mid-write,
    not a target-state clash — and sending them to clear a clash that does not
    exist is the #619 defect this taxonomy exists to prevent."""

    failed merge and its cleanup — stranding a started `--no-ff` mid-merge with
    MERGE_HEAD set — and lands in the caller's content-conflict arm wearing a
    probe error's text, with a remedy that is fiction here. Degraded SILENTLY
    instead, the empty reading routes to `MergePreflightError`, whose
    load-bearing clause — the working tree was never touched — the dead probe
    can no longer back. Both neighbours state what was measured; this class
    states that the measurement is missing.

    Reachable from the corner where nothing else answered. Over dead RESIDUE
    readings, unmerged stages (conflict) and MERGE_HEAD (commit refused) are read
    independently, so either still claims its own class — only the choice
    between "refused before starting" and "failed part-way through checkout"
    rests on that reading, and with it gone the honest answer is neither. The
    index and merge-state readings can die in the same window (#619): a dead
    index reading surrenders every class resting on "did not collide" —
    commit-refused and half-applied as much as pre-flight, since a state it
    cannot rule a conflict out of must not be dressed as either — and a dead
    merge-state reading additionally skips the abort it gates, with the
    message saying so, because uncertainty never authorizes a repair write.
    The squash replay reading joins from the far side of a merge that
    SUCCEEDED: with `allow_empty_squash`'s staged-result reading dead, neither
    the no-op return nor a result to commit can be claimed, so nothing is
    committed, nothing is reset, and the message names the dead reading.

    No repair rides on it: `reset --hard` stays gated on a PROVEN
    tracked-residue attribution, because uncertainty must not be what authorizes
    rewriting the operator's checkout. Their own `git status` is not degraded —
    the message carries the probe's failure alongside git's own and sends them

    (#377) — so left uncaught any of them would bypass every `except GitError`

    `GitTimeoutError` for the callers that must distinguish an environment fault
    from git refusing. The decode fault carries no class of its own: git ran and
    returned, so it is a fact about the repository's bytes, not about the host.

    The decode fault is real, not theoretical: POSIX filenames are arbitrary
    bytes, and while `core.quotePath` C-quotes them to ASCII for ordinary
    porcelain, `-z` disables that quoting (`dirty_paths`, `branch_incoming_paths`,
    `commit_paths`), `worktree list --porcelain` never applied it, and `git diff`
    emits file *content* verbatim (`capture_diff`) — so one latin-1 file is
    enough. Translating is deliberately all this does; making such paths usable
    (`errors="surrogateescape"`) is a separate call, since surrogates would then
    flow into the UTF-8 journal and JSON writes downstream.

    `binary=True` skips the decode entirely and hands back the raw

    refusal, not a pass).

    Split from :func:`git_version_at_least` on purpose. This is the WIRING — probe,
    decode, delegate — and that is the PREDICATE. A test that fakes this one proves a
    call site is reached; a test that drives that one proves the comparison is right.
    Ablating either leaves the other's test green (#464), so they need separate seams
    to be separately provable.

    `git version` is safe against any path: it does no repository setup, so it exits
    0 where `rev-parse` fatals 128 on a malformed `.git/config` — the probe answers
    for the git BINARY, never for the repo. A non-zero rc is therefore already a
    fault, and is reported as an unreadable answer rather than swallowed.

    Raises `GitError` untouched when git could not be run at all — absent or
    unspawnable as `GitSpawnError`, hung as `GitTimeoutError`. That is a different
    fact from "too old" and each caller dispositions it differently, so it is
    deliberately not folded in here.

    `timeout_s` is the #390 per-call seam, forwarded verbatim: the CLI gates keep
    the engine bound, while a caller that must not stall — the TUI guard, on the
    event loop — asks with its own short deadline and treats the resulting
    `GitTimeoutError` as "could not look" rather than as a refusal, since a bound
    the CLI does not share must not decide a launch."""

    `exclude` is repo-relative posix dir prefixes whose changes don't count —
    used by the dev/bundle proof-of-work gate to ignore the orchestrator-owned
    BMAD artifacts (composed by `verify_dev_exclude_relpaths`, relative to the same
    root this is invoked against), so a session that only rewrites its own spec
    (e.g. the frontmatter-status reconcile) under them doesn't register as real
    implementation work. Mirrors
    `attempt_dirty`'s exclusion. Default `()` keeps the unscoped behavior.

    `baseline_untracked` is the untracked-file snapshot taken when the baseline
    was recorded; when given, those files already existed before the session ran
    and are subtracted, so pre-session residue (e.g. an earlier halt's saved
    intent-gap patch, which `_protected_relpaths` shields from every reset) can
    never masquerade as this session's work.

    ``include_untracked=False`` restricts proof to tracked, staged, or committed
    changes. It is used when verification adopts a later descendant baseline:
    the launch-time snapshot cannot establish whether an untracked file appeared
    before or after that later commit. The default preserves every established
    caller and exact-baseline proof.

    `None` means count EVERY untracked file — deliberately the *opposite* of
    `attempt_dirty`'s `None` = ignore-all, and not an oversight. The two gates
    fail open in opposite directions: a proof-of-work gate must fail open toward
    "work happened" (a pre-snapshot run must not have its gate silently
    weakened into never seeing new files), while a rollback gate must fail open
    toward "nothing to remove" (never delete a file it cannot prove this attempt
    created). Keep it that way.

    Every non-zero `git diff` result reads as "changed" here, INCLUDING a refusal
    (rc 128 — an unresolvable baseline, a repo git will not read). That is the
    fail-open above, and it is deliberate for a gate. A caller that needs to tell

    anything else is the command failing rather than answering (rc 128 for a
    baseline it cannot resolve or a directory that is not a repository). The gate
    above cannot act on that distinction — uncertainty there must keep the
    stricter path — but a pure OBSERVATION must, because recording an

    ``observe_skipped_proof`` arm) files "the gate would have found changes"

    wildmatch metacharacters — but the harm here runs the other way: an over-matching
    exclusion HIDES a diff instead of exposing a file. `_changes_since` (the

    check exists to prevent (#423 item 3).

    It also realigns this half with :func:`_path_under_any`, the Python `startswith`

    differently about what "under the artifact dir" means. Literal is the reading
    `_path_under_any` already implements, which is why fixing the git half is the right
    direction and not a coin flip.

    rollback step touches at all (`reset --hard` skips it, and this module never runs
    `git clean`). A caller that reasons only over "tracked vs untracked" silently
    files every ignored path under whichever branch it wrote last.

    Only the output's EMPTINESS is read, never its text: `core.quotePath` mangles
    non-ASCII names, and a tracked-but-deleted-from-the-worktree path still lists (the
    index entry outlives the file), which is exactly the state a caller must not
    mistake for "not git's". Not `--error-unmatch`, which reports "not tracked" and
    "git blew up" with the same non-zero rc; not `check-ignore`, which answers whether
    a RULE matches rather than whether git owns the path — a `git add -f`'d file under
    an ignore rule has to read tracked here.

    Reads `stdout` ALONE, not `_git`'s stdout+stderr merge: `ls-files` exits 0 while
    still writing to stderr — a `core.fsmonitor` hook that cannot exec, an unknown
    `core.fsyncMethod` — and against the merged stream that chatter reads as an index
    entry for a path git does not track at all. The failure is silent and inverted
    (untracked answers "tracked"), so callers act on the opposite of the truth. The
    error path keeps the merge, where stderr is the only informative half.

    The pathspec is forced LITERAL, because git reads a positional operand as a
    PATHSPEC and not as a path: `[`, `]`, `*` and `?` in ``rel`` are wildmatch
    metacharacters, so a probe for an ABSENT path answers True the moment some OTHER
    tracked path happens to match the glob. The error is one-directional —
    `match_pathspec_item` compares literally before it falls through to fnmatch, so a
    genuinely tracked path never reads untracked — and it runs toward the answer that
    authorizes leaving a file alone, which is how a harvested ledger under an
    operator-named `implementation_artifacts` (`bmadconfig._resolve` takes that key
    verbatim, metacharacters and all) outlived the rollback that discarded the code it
    described. Not the global `--literal-pathspecs` / `GIT_LITERAL_PATHSPECS` form,
    which would also disarm the `:(exclude)` magic `worktree_clean`, `_changes_since`
    and `attempt_dirty` are built on; the per-operand prefix is scoped to this call. It
    costs the callers nothing: that same literal comparison is what matches a DIRECTORY
    prefix, so `_bmad/render` still lists everything beneath it (`cmd_validate`'s
    render-tracked warning), and it additionally disarms a ``rel`` that itself begins
    with `:`, which git would otherwise parse as magic and answer the empty set for.
    Stable across the supported range, `GIT_FLOOR` to current;
    below a version that understands the prefix it would read as a literal FILENAME,
    match nothing and answer False, which is the one direction that authorizes a
    delete.

    Raises GitError like every other probe in this module. Callers inside a rollback
    `finally` catch it and degrade toward leaving the file alone: uncertainty must
    never authorize a delete. The message keeps the BARE ``rel``: the operator's path is
    its informative half and the magic prefix is our own plumbing.

    Three live callers, all reached through this one chokepoint: `git.render-tracked`

    it, a tracked regular FILE, or a tracked DIRECTORY prefix.

    The distinction :func:`path_tracked` deliberately does not draw. Its literal
    pathspec matches a directory prefix too — that is load-bearing there, which is why
    `_bmad/render` answers True for the whole tree beneath it — so a caller that must
    know *which* of the three it holds cannot get it from that boolean.

    ONE `ls-files` spawn answers all three, because the pathspec's literal comparison is
    itself what separates them: a tracked file lists exactly the name asked for, a
    tracked directory lists the entries BENEATH it (never the directory's own name), and
    a path with no index entry lists nothing. So the empty set is "untracked", the
    singleton `{rel}` is "file", and any other non-empty set is "dir". A D/F-conflicted
    index — one name carrying both a file entry and entries beneath it — therefore
    answers "dir", which degrades toward substituting per-file patterns for what
    provisioning actually wrote: still a shield over our own files, and wrong in the
    spare-a-pattern direction rather than the leaking one.

    The worktree git-add shield is what needs the three apart, because they want three
    different treatments (#392, #484). Measured, git 2.55.0:

    * An exclude pattern naming a tracked regular FILE suppresses NOTHING. git consults
      ignore rules only for untracked paths, so `git add -A` stages a modification to it
      regardless. The pattern's only effect is to make the file answer
      `ls-files -ci --exclude-standard`, i.e. read as tracked-and-ignored — which is a
      state repo-hygiene gates reject, and how a shield meant to keep the orchestrator's
      files OUT of a story commit came to block one instead. The pattern is dropped.
    * The same pattern over a tracked DIRECTORY really does hide new children, and no
      pattern shape keeps that AND clears the `-ci` report: `dir/*`, `dir/**` and a
      trailing negation all measured identical to `dir`, because gitignore cannot
      re-include anything under an excluded parent. That measurement stands; the verdict
      it once carried — keep the dir pattern, accept the report — is REVERSED (#484).
      Over a tracked directory the protection is already mostly inert, since
      modifications to tracked children stage regardless, so the pattern was buying only
      new-child coverage at the price of a false tracked-and-ignored report across the
      whole tree. It is replaced by one pattern per untracked file provisioning wrote.
      The residual — a session-created NEW child under a tracked tool directory can be
      staged — is accepted, and matches the project's own decision to track that tree.
    * An UNTRACKED path keeps its pattern unchanged: full protection, and nothing
      beneath it can answer `-ci` in the first place.

    `-z` and the BYTES accessor, unlike :func:`path_tracked`. This reads the output's
    TEXT rather than only its emptiness, so that function's reason for never looking —
    `core.quotePath` mangling non-ASCII names — becomes this one's problem instead.
    NUL-delimited output is never quoted, and comparing `os.fsencode(rel)` keeps a POSIX
    name that is undecodable in the locale codec comparable rather than raising (#377).

    The pathspec is forced LITERAL for BOTH directions of the metacharacter hazard, not
    just the sibling's one. Reading the text already refuses a glob's false positive on
    an ABSENT ``rel``: the stray match comes back under the NEIGHBOUR'S name, which is
    not the name asked for, so the set differs whatever the pathspec. What needs
    `:(literal)` is the opposite direction — when ``rel`` carries `[`, `]`, `*` or `?`
    and a glob-colliding neighbour is tracked too, a bare pathspec returns BOTH names.
    The set then exceeds the singleton and a genuine tracked FILE reads "dir", so the
    shield substitutes patterns for a tree it never wrote, for any project whose hook
    config or skill tree carries a metacharacter.

    Raises GitError like every other probe in this module; the shield's caller degrades
    by KEEPING the pattern it already holds, since a leaked seed file in a story commit
    is the worse of the two failures."""

    no answer that holds: under `core.autocrlf=true` — Git for Windows' system default,

    Git holds a path in two places and `commit_paths` writes both: `git add` copies the

    distinct from both HEAD and ``data`` therefore exists nowhere afterwards — not in
    the commit, which took the working tree, and not on disk — so proving only the
    working tree is not proving the carry destroys nothing. Measured: with the operator's
    edit staged and the working tree restored, the carry commits, the row is absent from
    HEAD and from disk, and the tree reads clean, the bytes surviving only as a dangling
    blob (#618).

    True when the index holds HEAD's own content, or already holds ``data``, or holds
    no entry for a path HEAD does not carry either — the first loses nothing git cannot
    still reach, the second is the write itself, and the third is empty in both places
    at once. Unmerged stages raise rather than answer: a half-resolved index is not a
    state this can prove anything about.

    An absent entry is NOT by itself "nothing to overwrite", which is why HEAD is
    consulted before accepting one. With HEAD carrying the path, no index entry is a
    staged DELETION — `git rm --cached`, the operator untracking a board they are
    about to gitignore, which is a shape this project documents rather than an exotic
    one — and the carry's `git add` restores the entry, leaving that intent nowhere:
    not in HEAD, which never had it, and not in the index that just lost it. Measured.

    CONTENT is the whole of what this proves, and that ceiling is deliberate.
    ``ls-files -s`` reports the entry's MODE too and this reads only the oid beside
    it, so an operator who stages nothing but an exec-bit flip
    (``update-index --chmod=+x``) leaves the blob identical, is approved here, and has
    that staged mode reset by the carry's ``git add``. 100644/100755 is the only pair
    that can reach it — a symlink entry (120000) carries a different blob, which the
    oid compare already catches — so the exposure is exactly an exec bit on a YAML
    data file that nothing reads and nothing runs. Widening the proof to index
    metadata no workflow here sets would protect nothing and hand the carry one more
    way to refuse an ordinary board. A caller must not read this as "the index entry
    is untouched"; it says "the index holds no content this write would lose".

    Both halves matter, and `check-ignore` answers both in one call: it consults the
    INDEX unless told not to (`--no-index` exists precisely to turn that off), so a
    tracked file under a matching rule reads NOT ignored here — rc 1 — which is
    exactly what `git add` does with it. That asymmetry is the #392 one seen from the
    other side: a rule over a tracked regular file suppresses nothing, because git
    consults ignore rules only for untracked paths. A probe that read the RULE alone
    would answer "ignored" for a `git add -f`'d board and drop it from a commit git
    would have taken. Measured, git 2.55.0.

    Takes an absolute `Path` rather than a repo-relative rel like its two siblings
    above, because its caller holds a CONFIGURED path (`ProjectPaths.sprint_status`,
    resolved out of the operator's `_bmad/bmm/config.yaml`) rather than a git-derived
    relpath, and the answer has to be about the same rel :func:`commit_paths` will
    derive from that same `Path`. Deriving it twice in two modules is how the two
    drift apart. Out-of-repo answers False for the same reason `commit_paths` skips
    such a path: there is nothing here to omit from a commit that will not contain it.

    The one probe in this module that CANNOT force a literal operand: `check-ignore`
    parses pathspec magic and then rejects it outright — `:(literal)x` exits 128 with
    "pathspec magic not supported by this command" (measured, git 2.55.0) — so the
    hardening `path_tracked` documents at length is unavailable. It is also not
    needed for the glob half: gitignore matching makes the PATTERN the wildmatch and
    the pathname a literal, so `[`, `]`, `*` and `?` in ``rel`` are inert (verified
    against a repo holding both `d[a]/b.yaml` and `da/b.yaml` under a `da/` rule —
    the metacharacter path correctly reads not-ignored).

    The leading `./` is what stands in for it, and it is load-bearing: magic is
    recognized only on an operand that STARTS with `:`, so a prefix that is a no-op
    as a path is enough to make git read the whole rel as a pathname. Without it a
    ``rel`` beginning with `:` fails TWO ways, not one, and the quiet way is the
    reason this is not merely cosmetic (both measured, git 2.55.0):

    - UNSUPPORTED magic (`:(literal)`, `:(icase)`, `:!`, `:^`) exits 128, which
      surfaces as `GitError` and degrades to "not ignored" — a gitignored board then
      stays in `confirm`'s operand list and `git add` refuses the WHOLE list with it,
      losing the spec and park-record writes that #577 exists to keep.
    - SUPPORTED magic (`:(top)`, `:/`) is accepted, and git answers about the path
      the magic DENOTES rather than the file named on disk: `:(top)board.yaml` reads
      rc 0 whenever a plain `board.yaml` is ignored, even though nothing matches the
      real file. That is a silent wrong answer in the drop direction — `confirm`
      would omit a perfectly committable board and never commit its advance.

    Verified that `./` costs neither contract above: the index consultation still
    reads a tracked-and-ignored board as not-ignored, and `d[a]/f.md` still reads
    literally beside an ignored `da/`.

    Raises GitError like every other probe in this module. Its caller degrades by
    treating the path as NOT ignored, which keeps it in the commit — the behavior

    following ``git reset --hard`` (whose post-reset cleanup in
    :func:`safe_rollback` also deletes run-created untracked files) cannot
    silently destroy an attempt's in-progress work. The snapshot survives
    ``git gc`` and is recoverable by name (``git checkout <ref> -- .`` or
    ``git diff HEAD <ref>``).

    Captured through a throwaway temp index so the real index and working tree
    are left untouched: seed the temp index from HEAD, ``add -u`` the tracked
    edits/deletions, then stage only the untracked files *this run* created —
    ``untracked_files(repo)`` minus ``baseline_untracked`` (the snapshot taken
    when the baseline was captured). This mirrors :func:`safe_rollback`'s scope
    exactly: the snapshot holds precisely what the reset would destroy and never
    a pre-existing user untracked file. When ``baseline_untracked`` is ``None`` (a
    pre-upgrade/resumed run with no snapshot) no untracked file is staged — matching
    :func:`safe_rollback`, which then deletes none — so tracked edits are still
    parked but untracked files are left untouched. Ignored files are excluded
    throughout unless a caller supplies a trusted literal ``force_include`` path.
    Recovery uses that narrow exception for an attempt-bound spec whose durable
    byte snapshot proves the child changed a baseline-untracked or ignored file;
    ``git add -f`` then parks the child bytes before recovery restores the input.
    The caller must validate those paths as trusted regular files first. A tree is
    written and ``commit-tree``'d parented at HEAD
    under a synthetic ``bmad-loop`` identity so the snapshot commit succeeds even
    when no local/global git ``user.name``/``user.email`` is configured, then
    ``ref_name`` is pointed at the result. Compares only against HEAD — committed
    work above baseline is already parked by :func:`preserve_commits`, so this
    captures exactly what is not yet committed.

    Returns ``ref_name`` on success, or ``None`` when the tree is clean relative
    to HEAD (nothing to preserve — the intended non-destructive uncommitted-revert
    case). Raises :class:`GitError` on any git failure — the raise *surfaces* the
    capture failure so the caller can decide. Since #340 the recovery ref is a
    gate, not a safety net: the worktree caller's old best-effort "journal the
    failure and proceed" contract is gone, and a plain rollback now refuses to
    reset past work it could not park (only a re-drive, whose caller contract
    forbids pausing, still journals and lets the human-directed reset run).

    The three reads whose text IS the answer — ``write-tree``,
    ``rev-parse <head>^{tree}`` and ``commit-tree`` — take stdout ALONE
    (``_git_out``, #442). Git exits 0 while still warning on stderr, and against
    the merged stream all three answer a warning-suffixed "sha": the
    ``tree == head_tree`` comparison then reads unequal on a tree identical to
    HEAD, and ``update-ref`` is handed a non-ref. Because of the gate above, that
    leaves a host whose git config warns with no working rollback at all. The
    rc-only ``_git_env`` calls stay on the merge — they spend their output on a
    raise and never read it as a value.

    Not every failure here is a :class:`GitError`: spawn faults arrive typed as
    :class:`GitSpawnError` since #343, but the ``TemporaryDirectory`` below can

    Reverts tracked changes to `baseline` (the dev attempt's commits/edits),
    then removes only untracked files that appeared since `baseline` — i.e.
    files this run created. Untracked files already present at baseline, every
    ignored file, and anything under a `keep` dir are preserved. The orchestrator
    therefore never runs `git clean -fd`, so it can't eat a user's pre-existing
    untracked work. `baseline_untracked` is the snapshot taken when the baseline
    was captured; None (a pre-upgrade run with no snapshot) removes nothing.

    `preserve` is repo-relative posix dir prefixes (the BMAD artifact folders)
    whose *tracked* content must survive the hard reset — e.g. a frozen spec the
    resolve workflow just corrected, or a sentinel it deliberately deleted. The
    `git reset --hard` would otherwise revert them (keep only guards untracked
    deletion). We snapshot the current tree with `git stash create`, enumerate
    tracked deletions inside the preserved prefixes, reset, then restore the
    snapshot's present paths and replay its deletions. If the snapshot or deletion
    inventory cannot be read we raise *before* the reset rather than proceed with
    an incomplete restore: that would revert exactly what `preserve` names, and it
    would do so silently. Untracked artifacts need no special handling: the reset
    leaves them alone and the cleanup below skips `keep` dirs.

    `policy.toml` (the operator's orchestration config) is *always* restored,
    regardless of `preserve`. It lives inside the kept `.bmad-loop` dir but is
    *tracked*, so a plain `git reset --hard` would silently revert it — an
    uncommitted edit (e.g. a freshly enabled `scm.rollback_on_failure`, gone
    before it ever takes effect) or a change committed after `baseline`. `keep`
    only guards untracked deletion, not tracked reverts. We can't ride the stash
    snapshot for it: `git stash create` emits an empty snapshot for a clean tree,
    so a policy change living in a *commit* (with no other working-tree dirt)
    would skip the restore and be lost. Instead we read policy.toml's on-disk
    content before the reset and write it straight back after — independent of
    the snapshot, covering both the uncommitted and committed cases.

    Before either stash creation or reset, every path needed by the later
    untracked cleanup is canonicalized into a confined plan, including its prune
    bounds. Resolution uncertainty raises ``RollbackPreflightError`` with the
    filesystem fault as its cause, so the caller can pause while the tree is

    merge of `branch` can proceed, returning the cleaned paths (empty when the
    tree was already clean).

    Background: with engine `editor_mode = "per_worktree"`, a competing Editor
    can leak asset writes (`.cs.meta` GUIDs, asmdef auto-edits) into the *main*
    checkout. The merge then aborts pre-flight ("local changes / untracked files
    would be overwritten"). Those leaked copies are Editor-generated duplicates of
    content already committed on `branch`, so cleaning them is safe — the merge
    re-creates the canonical versions.

    Guard: only paths that lie within the branch's incoming set are cleaned. A dirty
    path *outside* that set is real operator work and is never touched. Whether it also
    BLOCKS the merge is decided per path by the INDEX column, not by trackedness
    (#618): the merge writes only paths that differ between `target` and `branch`, so
    a stray git has nothing staged for — untracked, or tracked and edited in the
    working tree only — can be neither overwritten by the merge nor written into its
    commit. Measured on both topologies and both strategies: rc 0, the edit survives
    uncommitted, and it is absent from the resulting commit. A STAGED stray is the
    real hazard, and it is one under both strategies — `merge --no-ff` refuses it
    outright, and so does `merge --squash` against a diverged target; only a
    fast-forwardable `--squash` accepts it, and that one FOLDS the operator's staged
    work into the story's commit.

    ``protected`` names repo-relative posix paths the ORCHESTRATOR itself commits
    after the merge, and a stray among them blocks whatever its index column says.
    The merge's own inertness does not protect them, because the merge is not what
    would commit them: ``commit_paths`` runs `git add -- :(literal)<path>` and then a
    pathspec commit, so ANY working-tree change to a named path is committed no
    matter who wrote it. The run's carry bookkeeping passes the sprint board and the
    deferred-work ledger through that call — ``_carry_board_advance``
    unconditionally — so an operator's private unstaged edit to one of those files
    lands in git history under a `chore(sprint-status): carry ...` message, leaving
    the tree clean and no trace of the substitution. The blast radius is strictly
    SAME-PATH: `git commit -- <pathspec>` is implicitly `--only`, so dirt on any
    other path is never swept in, which is why this list is a set of exact paths and
    not a policy. Default empty — the wiring is the caller's.

    ``on_tolerated``, when given, is called once with the sorted list of stray paths
    the guard walked past — the exact complement of the blocking ones within the
    strays, and the mirror of the returned ``cleaned`` list — so a merge that
    proceeded over operator dirt leaves the same kind of trace as one that cleaned a
    leak. Not called when there are no such paths.

    rolls its INDEX back but leaves the files it already wrote in the working
    tree, and an untracked file is by definition absent from HEAD and from the
    index, so both diffs read CLEAN over it. Sampled before and after the merge
    and differenced, so the answer is "git wrote this", not "this is here" — the
    same before/after discipline the tracked half uses, and for the same reason:
    an absolute post-merge reading would attribute the operator's own strays to
    git.

    `--exclude-standard` deliberately keeps ignored files out. They are not
    residue this can act on: an ignored path is invisible to the next merge's
    pre-flight too, so it cannot produce the resume failure this probe exists to
    name, and reporting one would send the operator after a file their own
    `.gitignore` says is theirs.

    NUL-delimited, and read through `_run_git` directly for the same reason
    `capture_diff` does: this needs stdout VERBATIM and stderr for the error text,
    which no single `_git*` wrapper hands back together. `ls-files --others`
    applies `core.quotePath` C-quoting to non-ASCII paths, and a line-splitting
    read with `.strip()` also eats leading and trailing spaces from a filename —
    harmless to the delta, since both samples would be mangled identically, but
    not to the ANSWER: these names are handed to the operator with an instruction
    to clear them, and a quoted or trimmed name is one they cannot act on. Two
    distinct paths can also strip to the same string, which would let a
    pre-existing stray mask a real materialization. `dirty_paths` and
    `branch_incoming_paths` already read path lists this way.

    Taking stdout verbatim also covers the #442 advisory hazard the merged stream
    has: git writes warnings to stderr at rc 0, and against `_git`'s merge a
    warning line would become a phantom path in the set.

    RAISES on a failed read rather than degrading the way its neighbours
    `_index_unmerged` and `_merge_in_progress` do (each hands back an unread
    marker), and the difference is position, not importance: this is one half
    of a PAIR, so a silent empty set is not a neutral answer — an empty BEFORE
    against a real AFTER reports every stray already in the checkout as
    something git just wrote, and the message tells the operator to clear what
    it names. Failing the merge outright is the smaller harm, and the
    before-read that would produce that asymmetry runs while nothing has been
    mutated yet.

    That argument covers only the BEFORE reading, which is why the AFTER reading
    goes through `_merge_residue`: post-merge, this same raise would bypass the

    Two ceilings survive, stated rather than patched around. A path already
    dirty BEFORE the merge stays unattributable — per path now, not per tree —
    because the delta cannot say which bytes are whose. And a concurrent edit
    to a path INSIDE the incoming set is indistinguishable from git's own

    three unmerged stages and conflict markers while creating no MERGE_HEAD at

    tree to its pre-merge state.
    Expects the target checkout to be clean; the worktree pipeline reconciles
    Editor-induced dirt first via `clean_incoming_collisions`.

    A failure git raised at PRE-FLIGHT — an untracked file the merge would
    overwrite, a staged change on an incoming path, a file/directory shape clash,
    an `--ff-only` target that cannot fast-forward — never started a merge and
    left the tree untouched, so it raises the `MergePreflightError` subclass with
    git's own text passed through verbatim (#619). "git said no" is not enough to
    earn that class, though; see the fourth state below, where git says no after
    having already written part of the incoming tree.

    Four measured states, one terminal fallback, and no one probe orders them.
    `_index_unmerged` leads and answers
    CONTENT: unmerged stages mean the merge ran and collided (raised as
    `MergeConflictError`, so the caller never has to read "bare GitError" as
    "conflict"). Its absence does not
    mean the merge never ran — a `--no-ff` whose commit was refused leaves a
    cleanly merged index, no unmerged stages, and MERGE_HEAD set (measured for
    `pre-merge-commit`, `commit-msg`, and an unsignable `commit.gpgsign`).
    MERGE_HEAD is the second question and parts those two, which is why it is read
    BEFORE the abort that erases it rather than only to decide whether to abort at
    all.

    MERGE_HEAD alone would be wrong in the other direction — the error the old
    "no MERGE_HEAD created" framing made — because a conflicted `--squash` leaves
    unmerged stages and no MERGE_HEAD. The squash MERGE INVOCATION cannot be
    commit-refused — `--squash` stops before committing by design (measured:
    rc 0 with a rejecting `pre-merge-commit` hook installed) — which is why only
    the `merge` leg reads MERGE_HEAD below. The LEG still reaches that state:
    it seals the staged result with its own plain `git commit`, where hooks and
    `commit.gpgsign` run like anywhere else, and a refusal there raises the same
    `MergeCommitRefusedError` — rolled back by `reset --hard HEAD` under the
    leg's pre-merge dirtiness gate rather than by an abort, and reported
    ``staged`` when that gate or the reset itself declines. The scope error to
    not repeat: "no hook runs" was measured of the merge invocation and is false
    of the leg, whose commit step is a second, later place git can say no.

    The fourth state is the one ALL THREE legs reach and no index probe can see:
    git dying part-way through the CHECKOUT. It leaves no unmerged stages, no
    MERGE_HEAD, and an index rolled back to HEAD, so every index- and HEAD-based
    reading calls it "refused before starting" and tells the operator their
    checkout is untouched — while the residue blocks the next merge's pre-flight,
    and the run fails identically on every resume over paths nothing named.
    `--ff-only` is not exempt, and the "it never starts a merge" premise this
    module used to carry was simply wrong: `--ff-only` declines the TOPOLOGY
    question only, and once the fast-forward is possible it checks the incoming
    tree out like any other merge (measured under a required smudge filter, all
    three strategies; HEAD does not move).

    The residue has two axes, which is why `_residue_snapshot` reads two probes
    and not one — and attribution on both is per PATH: a before/after delta
    intersected with the branch's incoming set, so neither the operator's
    pre-existing dirt nor a CONCURRENT edit of theirs landing during the merge
    window is ever called git's (the latter was the seventh mislabeled state: a
    repo-wide dirtiness boolean attributed the bystander edit to git and the
    repo-wide reset riding on it destroyed the edit — measured on all three
    legs). An incoming path the target did not already track lands as an
    UNTRACKED file, which no restore reaches — `reset --hard` and `merge --abort`
    both leave untracked files alone, and the latter exits 128 here besides, there
    being no merge to abort — so it is reported for the operator to clear. An
    incoming path the target DID track is modified in place, which a path-scoped
    `git checkout HEAD --` over exactly the attributed paths does undo.
    Either axis raises `MergeHalfAppliedError` — a SIBLING of `MergePreflightError`,
    since the two are mutually exclusive by construction (a refusal git makes at
    pre-flight is made before any file is written).

    The terminal fallback is a post-merge reading that itself FAILED. Every
    probe in that window degrades to an unread marker rather than raising —
    the raise would escape between the failed merge and its cleanup — and a
    verdict may only stand on readings that are live. Dead residue readings —
    either delta's, or the incoming set's that attributes them — surrender
    only the choice between "refused before starting" and "failed
    part-way" (conflict and commit-refused stand on their own measurements
    over it). A dead index reading surrenders every claim resting on "did not
    collide" — commit-refused, half-applied, and pre-flight alike. A dead
    merge-state reading additionally skips the abort, which that reading
    gates: `merge --abort` is a repair write, and uncertainty never
    authorizes one, so the message says none was attempted. Whatever cannot
    be claimed raises `MergeResidueUnreadError`, and every dead probe is
    named in the message whichever class raises.

    ``allow_empty_squash`` is recovery-only: re-running a squash that committed
    before a host loss stages nothing because the target already has the merged
    tree. That clean result confirms the replay without manufacturing an empty
    commit; ordinary squash calls keep commit failures strict.

    frontmatter block.

    Same verified in-place line surgery as `set_frontmatter_status` (no YAML
    round-trip) so the spec's formatting, comments, and field order survive, and
    the same three-way return: True on a landed rewrite, False for **nothing to
    change** (no file, no frontmatter block, already at the value), and
    `FrontmatterWriteError` when the reader can see the key in a shape no line
    edit can safely move. "Comments survive" includes a trailing inline comment
    on the edited line itself: this shares `frontmatter._replace_value` with the
    status helper, so it inherits that renderer's certified-boundary carry (and
    its quote drop) rather than restating either.

    Unlike the status helper, a missing key is INSERTED as the block's last
    line: callers assert a field's value whether or not the skill wrote one
    (the patch-restore re-arm re-stamps ``baseline_revision``, which only the
    skill's step-03 writes). The insert is now gated on what `read_frontmatter`
    SEES rather than on a line-scan miss, which was a defect of its own — a
    quoted ``"baseline_revision":`` was missed by the scan and a second one
    appended, so the spec carried the key twice and the reader resolved the
    wrong one.

    Byte-preserving on the same terms as its sibling: ``read_bytes().decode`` in
    and bytes out, so a CRLF spec is not relaid to LF (nor an LF one to CRLF on
    Windows) by a write contracted to move one field. The INSERTED line takes the
    block's own ending, not a bare ``\\n``.

    Atomic on the same terms too (#379), and CONFINED on the same terms (#593):

    """Repo-relative posix paths the dev/bundle proof-of-work gate excludes from
    its probe (`_changes_since`, via `_verify_shared_gates.proof_of_work_probe`) —
    file-granularity, unlike `artifact_relpaths`' whole-folder
    exclusion. `artifact_relpaths` has NO production caller left: rollback
    protection builds its own list in `recovery_flow.protected_relpaths` against
    `workspace.root`, and `Engine._protected_relpaths` merely delegates there. Do
    not adopt it as a shortcut — it is still anchored on `paths.project`, which is
    #716's root cause. Deliberately does NOT exclude `output_folder`:
    in the standard layout it is the parent directory of `implementation_artifacts`/
    `planning_artifacts`, so excluding it as a directory prefix would swallow those
    two folders' content right back out of view via the same git-pathspec prefix
    match this function exists to avoid.

    Excludes only what a session rewrites regardless of whether it did any real
    work: `paths.sprint_status` (every session advances it as routine bookkeeping)
    and the session's own claimed `spec_path` (so a bare frontmatter status flip on
    it doesn't count). Sibling content under the implementation/planning artifact
    dirs — the deferred-work ledger, other stories' specs — is deliberately left
    un-excluded, so a story whose entire authorized scope is ledger/spec
    reconciliation registers as real work instead of a permanent false "no changes
    since baseline".

    `restore_patch` (the task's latched intent-gap patch file, BMAD-METHOD #2564)
    is excluded too when set: the patch is untracked halt residue under the
    protected artifact dirs that survives every reset, so counting it would let a
    restore re-drive whose session produced nothing pass the gate on the patch
    file's mere presence — the gate must key on the APPLIED work (the tracked diff
    from baseline), not on the orchestrator-owned patch that carried it.

    `spec_path` comes from a session-reported (untrusted) `spec_file` string, so
    it is `.resolve()`d before deriving the relpath, same as `spec_within_roots`:
    an un-normalized `..`/`.` segment would still resolve to the real on-disk
    file (the OS resolves it), but as a raw string it wouldn't match git's own
    normalized path output, silently defeating this exclude and letting a bare
    status flip on the session's own spec count as real work.

    ``root`` is the tree the resulting pathspecs are relative to, and MUST be the
    same root the caller invokes git against — `paths.repo_root` for the
    proof-of-work gate, which is where the probe runs. REQUIRED, with no
    default: an implicit `paths.project` anchor is #716's own root cause, and the
    two roots collapse in every configuration but the `repo_root` override, so a
    defaulted caller would look correct everywhere it was tested and be wrong only
    on the one config that matters. Requiring it turns OMITTING the root into a
    type error; it does not police a WRONG one — ``root=paths.project`` type-checks
    cleanly and silently excludes nothing, which is the failure the next paragraph
    describes. The requirement buys a caller who must think about the root, not a
    checker that knows the right answer.

    A relpath computed against the wrong root does not raise: it simply
    matches nothing on git's side, so the exclusion silently disappears and a bare
    status flip starts counting as real work. The latched `restore_patch` is
    anchored on the SAME root for the same reason (a relative latch names a path
    in the tree it will be applied to)."""

    :class:`_SharedGateResult` whose ``outcome`` is a failing
    :class:`VerifyOutcome`, or ``None`` when every gate passes and the caller may
    run its mode-specific tail.

    The proof-of-work exclude is derived here from the `task` this gate already
    receives (`verify_dev_exclude_relpaths`, which needs the latched restore patch);
    ``extra_exclude`` carries only what a mode adds on top — the engine-written
    paths for sprint and bundle, those plus the story record + manifest for
    stories, and ``None`` on the two legs that skip the gate outright (sprint's
    park, stories' plan halt). Threading the restore patch in
    from three call sites instead left a default-None foot-gun for a future fourth
    mode, which would silently let a restore re-drive pass proof-of-work on the
    patch file's mere presence. ``extra_exclude=None`` still skips the gate
    outright, and two callers now spell it for two different reasons: a plan-halt
    leg produced only its own spec (structurally spec-only), and a park may
    legitimately have produced no code at all because its remaining work is a
    human's (#676). Both mean "there is no diff to demand here"; neither
    generalizes to the other's leg, so keep them named separately.

    ``observe_skipped_proof`` is the same exclusion tuple the caller WOULD have
    passed as ``extra_exclude`` had it not skipped the gate. When set on a skipped
    leg the probe still runs — against the baseline derived above, not the raw
    ``task.baseline_commit`` — purely to answer whether there was in fact a diff,
    and the answer rides out on ``_SharedGateResult.skipped_proof_zero_diff``.
    Nothing branches on it here: a fault degrades to ``None`` rather than
    escalating, and the leg's outcome is identical either way. It exists so an
    accepted park's skipped gate stops being silent (#676) — a park the waived
    gate would have passed and one it would have refused are otherwise
    indistinguishable after the fact.

    Exactly one of the two skipping legs asks for it, and the asymmetry is
    deliberate rather than an omission: only sprint mode's PARK passes it.
    ``verify_dev_stories``' plan halt skips the gate and observes nothing, because
    it already has an independent cross-check a park has no equivalent for — a
    clean plan-halt carries ``devcontract``'s ``plan_halt`` marker in its
    result.json (``rj.get("plan_halt") is not True`` refuses the leg outright), so
    a died-mid-flight ``ready-for-dev`` cannot reach the skip in the first place. A
    park's status is self-asserted with no such marker, which is why it is the leg
    that needs a record of what the waived gate would have found.

    The two parameters are MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE by construction: ``extra_exclude``
    gates and ``observe_skipped_proof`` observes, and the arms below are ``if`` /
    ``elif`` on that order. Passing both is not a richer mode, it is a caller
    error that silently drops the observation — the gate arm wins and the leg was
    never skipped, so there was nothing to observe. Pass ``extra_exclude`` OR
    ``observe_skipped_proof``, never both."""

    """Verify a dev session's on-disk artifacts against its result.json claims.

    Checks the claimed spec exists, carries the fixed ``auto-dev`` workflow tag,
    sits at the expected status (``in-review`` when a separate review session
    follows, ``done`` when review is disabled), records a baseline matching the
    orchestrator's, has produced changes since that baseline (every leg but the
    park — see ``operator_park`` below), and that the story's sprint-status was
    advanced to the matching stage. Returns a retryable VerifyOutcome on any
    mismatch, escalates on git failure, passes otherwise.

    ``operator_park`` (``[operator] enabled``, engine-supplied) adds one more
    accepted spec/sprint pair: ``(awaiting-operator, awaiting-operator)``, the
    park a dev session declares when the story's remaining work is a human's
    (#335). The OBSERVED spec status selects which pair is demanded — the skill
    decides whether it parked, and the gate then holds it to the matching board
    state and to a non-empty action list. Off by policy, the token is simply not
    a terminal the gate knows, so it fails the ordinary status check and the
    session is retried with that mismatch as feedback.

    The proof-of-work gate is skipped on a park that this attempt was in a
    position to newly ELECT — ``skip_proof = parked and park_eligible``, a
    two-part selector. ``parked`` is what the session left behind (the observed
    spec status, plus the policy flag); ``park_eligible`` is what the orchestrator
    knew at dispatch (:meth:`Engine._park_eligible_at_dispatch`, captured on the
    fresh entry into ``Engine._dev_phase`` from the same instant and the same
    condition as ``task.baseline_commit``): the story's bound spec did NOT already
    read ``awaiting-operator``. Both halves are load-bearing. The skip exists
    because a park's whole output can legitimately be its own spec's park
    declaration plus the board sync, both of which proof-of-work already excludes,
    so demanding a diff read a correct park as "no changes since baseline commit"
    and refused it (#676) — costing the attempt, and with it the park declaration:
    reverted outright under ``isolation = "worktree"`` or
    ``scm.rollback_on_failure = true``, and a paused run with manual-recovery steps
    on the default in-place config. What is still pending here is the
    ORCHESTRATOR's commit — the squash plus the park record land only after this
    gate passes — not the session's own work: ``bmad-build-auto`` commits each
    iteration, so a skill commit chain usually already sits above baseline
    (``Engine._finalize_commit_phase``), and a reset discards that too, onto an
    ``attempt-preserve/*`` ref.

    What the eligibility half defends is narrow and worth naming exactly. Before
    it, the relaxation was selected entirely by state a fresh session could
    INHERIT rather than produce: a spec an earlier attempt left at
    ``awaiting-operator`` still reads ``awaiting-operator`` to the next session
    that does nothing at all, so a re-drive over that spec selected the skip and
    verified green on someone else's declaration, relaxing #676's skip for an
    attempt that produced nothing. Requiring the
    orchestrator's own dispatch-time answer means the leg that skips proof-of-work
    is the leg that actually authored the park. It does NOT defend against a
    session that elects a park it did not earn — one that writes the frontmatter,
    lists plausible actions and implements nothing is eligible by construction and
    still passes, because the actions gate tests list non-emptiness and never
    content. It is a check on WHICH ATTEMPT owns the park, not on whether the park
    is honest, and it is captured per PHASE rather than per attempt: a fixable
    repair deliberately keeps the previous session's tree, so re-observing would
    make every repair of a malformed park ineligible and fail it on the gate it
    just re-armed.

    An INELIGIBLE park is not refused — it is merely held to proof-of-work like
    any other terminal. The park's status pair, ``operator_actions``
    non-emptiness, workflow tag, baseline match and sprint pair all keep selecting
    on the observed status alone, so an inherited park carrying a real diff passes
    exactly as before; only the residue-free one now owes the diff it never
    produced.

    Nothing else relaxes on the eligible leg either — the ``operator_actions``
    gate above still refuses a park that enumerates nothing, and the workflow-tag,
    status, baseline-match and sprint-pair gates all still run. Two of those four
    are not independent evidence on this leg, and saying so is the point: the
    status check is tautological here (the same ``fm`` that selected ``parked`` is
    threaded in as ``fm=fm``, so the shared gate compares it against an
    ``expected_status`` derived from itself), and the sprint pair was written from
    that same frontmatter by ``Engine._post_dev_state_sync`` a dozen lines before
    this gate runs, so it confirms the orchestrator's own write landed rather than
    anything the session did. What still binds a park to the attempt the
    orchestrator actually launched is the workflow tag, the baseline match, the
    non-empty actions list — and now the dispatch-time eligibility, which is the
    only one of the four the session cannot influence at all. Baseline-match also
    accepts a claim NEWER than the recorded baseline whenever it is a
    HEAD-reachable descendant, and the comment guarding that branch names the
    compensating control: such a commit "may have arrived in the shared checkout
    from outside the session", so the check re-anchors proof-of-work onto the
    claimed commit rather than trusting the match alone. Proof-of-work is precisely
    what this leg skips, so on a park that re-anchoring still gates nothing — but
    it is no longer inert: the observation below inherits it, so a foreign commit
    cannot be credited as this attempt's work in the record either.

    The accepted skip is no longer silent, and it is recorded on TWO fields
    because one cannot carry both facts. ``VerifyOutcome.park_proof_skipped`` is
    the waiver itself — ``skip_proof``, ``False`` on every other leg. When it
    fires, the shared gate additionally runs the proof-of-work probe as a pure
    OBSERVATION (``observe_skipped_proof=engine_written``) and what that probe
    found rides out on ``VerifyOutcome.park_zero_diff``: ``True`` when the waived
    gate would have found nothing it counts, ``False`` when it would have found
    something, ``None`` when the probe could not answer. Read ``False`` as exactly
    that and no further — the residue the gate counts is not attributed to a
    session, here or in the gate itself, because under a shared checkout it cannot
    be (see the newer-claim paragraph above, and `docs/FEATURES.md` on
    ``isolation``). What separates "unknown" from "no skip happened" is
    ``park_proof_skipped``, not this field — collapsing the two into
    ``park_zero_diff is not None`` would make a park whose probe faulted look like
    a leg that never waived anything, and it would go unrecorded — the silence
    this record exists to end. ``None`` means "the probe could not answer", and
    reaches here three ways: a ``GitError`` (timeout, spawn or decode fault), a
    git REFUSAL such as an unresolvable baseline (any rc that is not one of git's
    two real answers, rc 128 being the everyday one — the gate arm folds that into
    its fail-open, the observation arm keeps it as unknown), and an attempt
    carrying no ``task.baseline_commit`` to measure from (the shared gate runs
    neither arm without one). Neither field changes an outcome: an unanswerable
    probe degrades rather than escalating, and an eligible park verifies
    identically either way. Their consumer is
    :meth:`Engine._verify_dev_artifacts`, which journals
    ``park-proof-of-work-skipped`` for a waived gate that this function then
    PASSED, and carries the observation as that record's ``zero_diff`` field, so a
    park the waived gate would have passed and one it would have refused stop
    being indistinguishable afterwards (#676). Both ends of that scope are set here: a
    waiver refused by a later check in this function (the sprint pair) never
    reaches the record, and a record that IS written asserts only that this gate
    was cleared with proof-of-work waived — the configured ``[verify]`` commands,
    the review loop and the commit all run afterwards and may still reject the
    attempt, which is then retried or deferred with its record already written.

    ``engine_written`` names paths the orchestrator itself wrote above this gate
    during the attempt, relative to ``paths.repo_root`` — the tree the gate invokes
    git in, and therefore the root every pathspec composed into this exclusion set
    must share (#716). They compose with the mode's normal proof-of-work exclusions
    so engine bookkeeping cannot masquerade as session work; see
    :meth:`Engine._harvest_gate_exclude`, which is their producer and states what a
    ledger outside the code tree resolves to. On the skipped park leg they are
    passed as ``observe_skipped_proof`` instead of ``extra_exclude``: no gate
    consumes them there, but the zero-diff observation must exclude exactly what
    the gate would have, or the orchestrator's own bookkeeping writes would be
    counted as residue on the park's record.

      decode that ends the loop, so ``text=True`` never touched them.

      this branch is the only way the output arrives at all.
    * ``None`` — POSIX again, when nothing had been buffered on that stream.

    The two roots split by what is being addressed, and the split is deliberate:
    the artifacts these gates read — the claimed spec, ``paths.sprint_status``,
    ``paths.deferred_work`` — are BMAD output and stay project-rooted, while
    ``[verify] commands`` are the operator's build/test verbs and belong in the
    git root the code lives in. Every other caller of these commands already
    resolves them that way: the dev side runs them in ``Workspace.root``
    (``Engine._verify_commands_with_results``), which ``Workspace.default`` sets
    from ``paths.repo_root``, and ``cli._reverify`` is handed ``paths.repo_root``
    at both of its call sites. The three review gates were the sole outlier
    (#695).

    The two roots are the same path in the default layout and under worktree
    isolation (``ProjectPaths.rebased`` sets both); they diverge only under an
    explicit ``repo_root:`` with ``isolation = "none"``. One helper rather than
    three edited lines so the three gates cannot drift apart on the split.

    On win32 the cwd carries one more thing with it, so the split is not purely a
    subprocess concern: ``verify_commands_outcome`` forwards ``cwd`` a second time
    into ``env_fault_reason`` -> ``_win32_env_fault_reason``, which resolves a
    command's leading token as ``cwd / token`` to tell "tool missing" from "command
    failed" — and an env fault escalates where a plain failure retries. So a
    RELATIVE verify command is now classified against ``repo_root`` on these legs
    too. That is the correct direction (classification should follow execution, and
    the dev side already classifies against the same root), but it is a second
    consequence of the move rather than a restatement of the first.

    ``paths.repo_root`` is the ONLY member of ``paths`` this reads — it takes the
    whole dataclass to keep the three call sites uniform, not because it consults
    anything else. A future caller must not infer that artifact paths reach here.

    ``on_results`` is forwarded, not consumed: an engine-supplied sink is how
    review-gate results reach the journal, which the dev side has always had and
    these gates had not. Optional, so the gates stay callable from core (and from
    tests) with no engine at all — no sink simply means nothing is recorded,
    which is what every direct caller got before.

    This is also the ONLY sanctioned caller of ``verify_commands_outcome``; a
    fourth gate reaching past it would re-open #695. Enforced, not merely stated
    — see ``tests/test_portability_guard.py``.

    the sole ``sprint_advance`` caller, ``verify_dev`` asserted the write landed,
    and ``advance`` never regresses). A board now sitting *earlier* than ``done``
    is therefore not a stage the story never reached — it is a review session
    deliberately revoking the sign-off. Nothing in the review loop re-advances
    the board, so retrying only replays the same failure until the budget runs
    out and the work is rolled back; under
    ``review.on_status_contradiction = "escalate"`` (the default) the gate
    escalates instead, naming both sides. See #334.

    ``(awaiting-operator, awaiting-operator)`` is the second accepted pair, on
    the same observed-spec-status selection ``verify_dev`` uses: this is the gate
    the park path runs before committing (``Engine._park_awaiting_operator``), so
    parked work clears exactly the deterministic checks every other commit path
    clears *at this gate* — the pair, a non-empty action list, and the verify
    commands. The scope is load-bearing: a ``done`` story additionally clears
    proof-of-work at the dev gate, which a park no longer does (#676), so this
    gate is not evidence that a park faced every check a ``done`` story faced. The
    sign-off-regression arm stays scoped to the ``done`` pair: a board short of
    ``awaiting-operator`` is a stage never reached, not a revoked sign-off.

    ``operator_park`` is the SAME engine-supplied flag ``verify_dev`` takes, not a
    second reading of ``policy.operator.enabled``, so the two gates cannot
    disagree about whether this run parks. They would: the engine's
    ``_operator_park_enabled`` is an override seam, and a mode that opts out of
    parking while still reaching this gate would otherwise find it accepting a
    park the engine itself refuses to take.

    # Every operand is forced LITERAL: git reads a positional operand as a PATHSPEC,
    # and `implementation_artifacts` reaches here verbatim out of the operator's
    # `_bmad/bmm/config.yaml` (`bmadconfig._resolve` substitutes and resolves it, and
    # nothing sanitizes it), so a `[`, `]`, `*` or `?` in a configured path is a
    # wildmatch metacharacter. Unescaped, this function breaks its own first promise —
    # "commit exactly `paths` (and nothing else)": `add -- docs[a]/f.md` also stages
    # `docsa/f.md`, and the operator's unrelated edit is committed under a story's
    # name. The operand is a SUPERSET (git compares literally before falling through
    # to fnmatch), which is why the over-match direction is the only one possible.
    #
    # A second, quieter harm with the ledger GITIGNORED — the shape
    # `_carry_harvested_deferrals` is built to hit: `git add` refuses an explicitly
    # named ignored path (rc 1) but SKIPS a globbed one, so the plain form could exit
    # rc 0 having staged nothing, `status` find no change, and the carry report success
    # having committed no ledger and journalled no `harvest-carry-uncommitted` — a
    # silent loss where the literal form leaves a record. Note the `ls-files` operands
    # above are literalised too: that leg reads membership rather than acting, so its
    # failure direction is to DROP a rel (the glob returns the neighbour's name, which
    # never equals `r`), but leaving one bare operand beside three fixed ones is the
    # next reader's trap. It is also why the `r.replace("\\", "/")` that used to guard
    # this comparison is gone: `.as_posix()` above fixes the separator at the source,
    # and a dead normalizer beside a glob operand reads as protection that isn't there.
