    wildmatch metacharacters — but the harm here runs the other way: an over-matching
    exclusion HIDES a diff instead of exposing a file. `has_changes_since` and

    whose name carries a `*` excludes a sibling tree as well and the attempt reads
    CLEAN when it changed — the same false "no changes" that a dev attempt's dirtiness
    check exists to prevent (#423 item 3).

    It also realigns this half with :func:`_path_under_any`, the Python `startswith`

    the third state legible: neither tracked nor in that set means IGNORED, which no
    rollback step touches at all (`reset --hard` skips it, and this module never runs
    `git clean`). A caller that reasons only over "tracked vs untracked" silently
    files every ignored path under whichever branch it wrote last.

    Only the output's EMPTINESS is read, never its text: `core.quotePath` mangles
    non-ASCII names, and a tracked-but-deleted-from-the-worktree path still lists (the
    index entry outlives the file), which is exactly the state a caller must not
    mistake for "not git's". Not `--error-unmatch`, which reports "not tracked" and
    "git blew up" with the same non-zero rc; not `check-ignore`, which answers whether
    a RULE matches rather than whether git owns the path — a `git add -f`'d file under
    an ignore rule has to read tracked here.

    Reads `stdout` ALONE, not `_git`'s stdout+stderr merge: `ls-files` exits 0 while
    still writing to stderr — a `core.fsmonitor` hook that cannot exec, an unknown
    `core.fsyncMethod` — and against the merged stream that chatter reads as an index
    entry for a path git does not track at all. The failure is silent and inverted
    (untracked answers "tracked"), so callers act on the opposite of the truth. The
    error path keeps the merge, where stderr is the only informative half.

    The pathspec is forced LITERAL, because git reads a positional operand as a
    PATHSPEC and not as a path: `[`, `]`, `*` and `?` in ``rel`` are wildmatch
    metacharacters, so a probe for an ABSENT path answers True the moment some OTHER
    tracked path happens to match the glob. The error is one-directional —
    `match_pathspec_item` compares literally before it falls through to fnmatch, so a
    genuinely tracked path never reads untracked — and it runs toward the answer that
    authorizes leaving a file alone, which is how a harvested ledger under an
    operator-named `implementation_artifacts` (`bmadconfig._resolve` takes that key
    verbatim, metacharacters and all) outlived the rollback that discarded the code it
    described. Not the global `--literal-pathspecs` / `GIT_LITERAL_PATHSPECS` form,
    which would also disarm the `:(exclude)` magic `worktree_clean`, `has_changes_since`
    and `attempt_dirty` are built on; the per-operand prefix is scoped to this call. It
    costs the callers nothing: that same literal comparison is what matches a DIRECTORY
    prefix, so `_bmad/render` still lists everything beneath it (`cmd_validate`'s
    render-tracked warning), and it additionally disarms a ``rel`` that itself begins
    with `:`, which git would otherwise parse as magic and answer the empty set for.
    Stable from the git 2.20 floor `install._WORKTREE_CONFIG_GIT` declares to current;

    `finally` catch it and degrade toward leaving the file alone: uncertainty must
    never authorize a delete. The message keeps the BARE ``rel``: the operator's path is
    its informative half and the magic prefix is our own plumbing.

    * The same pattern over a tracked DIRECTORY really does hide new children, so it
      stays. There is no pattern shape that keeps that and clears the `-ci` report:
      `dir/*`, `dir/**` and a trailing negation all measured identical to `dir`, because
      gitignore cannot re-include anything under an excluded parent.

    `-z` and the BYTES accessor, unlike the sibling above. This reads the output's TEXT
    rather than only its emptiness, so the sibling's reason for never looking —
    `core.quotePath` mangling non-ASCII names — becomes this function's problem instead.
    NUL-delimited output is never quoted, and comparing `os.fsencode(rel)` keeps a POSIX
    name that is undecodable in the locale codec comparable rather than raising (#377).

    Raises GitError like every other probe in this module; the shield's caller degrades
    by KEEPING the pattern, since a leaked seed file in a story commit is the worse of
    the two failures."""

    :func:`safe_rollback` also deletes run-created untracked files) cannot
    silently destroy an attempt's in-progress work. The snapshot survives

    Captured through a throwaway temp index so the real index and working tree
    are left untouched: seed the temp index from HEAD, ``add -u`` the tracked
    edits/deletions, then stage only the untracked files *this run* created —
    ``untracked_files(repo)`` minus ``baseline_untracked`` (the snapshot taken
    when the baseline was captured). This mirrors :func:`safe_rollback`'s scope
    exactly: the snapshot holds precisely what the reset would destroy and never
    a pre-existing user untracked file. When ``baseline_untracked`` is ``None`` (a
    pre-upgrade/resumed run with no snapshot) no untracked file is staged — matching
    :func:`safe_rollback`, which then deletes none — so tracked edits are still
    parked but untracked files are left untouched. Ignored files are excluded throughout
    (``add -u`` only touches tracked paths; ``untracked_files`` honours
    ``.gitignore``). A tree is written and ``commit-tree``'d parented at HEAD
    under a synthetic ``bmad-loop`` identity so the snapshot commit succeeds even
    when no local/global git ``user.name``/``user.email`` is configured, then
    ``ref_name`` is pointed at the result. Compares only against HEAD — committed
    work above baseline is already parked by :func:`preserve_commits`, so this

    Returns ``ref_name`` on success, or ``None`` when the tree is clean relative

    case). Raises :class:`GitError` on any git failure — the raise *surfaces* the
    capture failure so the caller can decide. Since #340 the recovery ref is a
    gate, not a safety net: the worktree caller's old best-effort "journal the
    failure and proceed" contract is gone, and a plain rollback now refuses to
    reset past work it could not park (only a re-drive, whose caller contract
    forbids pausing, still journals and lets the human-directed reset run).

    :class:`GitSpawnError` since #343, but the ``TemporaryDirectory`` below can

    ignored file, and anything under a `keep` dir are preserved. The orchestrator

    untracked work. `baseline_untracked` is the snapshot taken when the baseline
    was captured; None (a pre-upgrade run with no snapshot) removes nothing.

    `preserve` is repo-relative posix dir prefixes (the BMAD artifact folders)
    whose *tracked* content must survive the hard reset — e.g. a frozen spec the
    resolve workflow just corrected. The `git reset --hard` would otherwise

    uncommitted edit (e.g. a freshly enabled `scm.rollback_on_failure`, gone
    before it ever takes effect) or a change committed after `baseline`. `keep`
    only guards untracked deletion, not tracked reverts. We can't ride the stash
    snapshot for it: `git stash create` emits an empty snapshot for a clean tree,
    so a policy change living in a *commit* (with no other working-tree dirt)

    advanced this story's sprint-status to ``done`` before the review ran (it is
    the sole ``sprint_advance`` caller, ``verify_dev`` asserted the write landed,
    and ``advance`` never regresses). A board now sitting *earlier* than ``done``
    is therefore not a stage the story never reached — it is a review session

    the board, so retrying only replays the same failure until the budget runs
    out and the work is rolled back; under
    ``review.on_status_contradiction = "escalate"`` (the default) the gate
    escalates instead, naming both sides. See #334.

    ``(awaiting-operator, awaiting-operator)`` is the second accepted pair, on
    the same observed-spec-status selection ``verify_dev`` uses: this is the gate
    the park path runs before committing (``Engine._park_awaiting_operator``), so
    parked work clears exactly the deterministic checks every other commit path
    clears — the pair, a non-empty action list, and the verify commands. The
    sign-off-regression arm stays scoped to the ``done`` pair: a board short of
    ``awaiting-operator`` is a stage never reached, not a revoked sign-off.

    ``operator_park`` is the SAME engine-supplied flag ``verify_dev`` takes, not a
    second reading of ``policy.operator.enabled``, so the two gates cannot
    disagree about whether this run parks. They would: the engine's
    ``_operator_park_enabled`` is an override seam, and a mode that opts out of
    parking while still reaching this gate would otherwise find it accepting a
