    the caller can say that instead of prescribing conflict resolution for it
    (#619)."""


class MergeCommitRefusedError(GitError):
    """The merge itself ran and resolved; git would not COMMIT the result.

    Measured causes: a `pre-merge-commit` or `commit-msg` hook exiting non-zero,
    and a `commit.gpgsign` that cannot produce a signature. Neither sibling's
    remedy fits — there is no content conflict to resolve and no target state to
    clear, only a policy or a key the operator's own repo configures — which is
    the whole reason this is a third type rather than either of theirs.

    Two legs reach it, through different commits. `--no-ff` is refused at the
    merge's own commit and leaves MERGE_HEAD, which is what parts it from a
    genuine pre-flight refusal — `merge_branch` reads that BEFORE its abort
    rather than only to decide whether to abort at all. (`_index_unmerged`
    cannot see this state: a merge that resolved cleanly leaves no unmerged
    stages whether or not the commit that would have sealed it was allowed.)
    The squash leg is refused at its OWN plain `git commit`, after
    `merge --squash` already staged the result — hooks and signing run there
    like anywhere else — so no MERGE_HEAD is involved and no classification is
    needed: the merge step succeeded, and the failed call identifies the state
    by itself.

    ``restored`` says whether the rollback that follows actually put the
    checkout back — `merge --abort` on the `--no-ff` leg, `reset --hard HEAD`
    on the squash leg (gated on the leg's pre-merge dirtiness snapshot: a
    checkout that already carried uncommitted work is never reset, #619). The
    squash rollback is deliberately whole-tree — it is undoing a SUCCEEDED
    merge whose staged result spans the entire incoming set — which leaves one
    stated ceiling: an operator edit landing after the pre-merge reading found
    the tree clean sits inside the reset's blast radius (see
    `_reset_hard_head`).
    It is an attribute rather than a type of its own because the operator's
    CAUSE is the same either way — a policy declined the commit — and only the first
    step of their remedy differs: a checkout left mid-merge has to be recovered
    before fixing that policy is worth anything, and a resume attempted before then
    fails again on the merge state rather than on the policy. A caller that ignores
    the flag still gets a true statement of the cause; one that reads it can order
    the two steps (#619).

    ``staged`` names WHERE an unrestored checkout stands, because the two legs
    strand differently and the operator's first step differs with them: False
    means mid-merge (MERGE_HEAD set, `git merge --abort` recovers it), True
    means the squash result is still sitting staged (`reset --hard HEAD` clears
    it — after their own uncommitted work, if that is what blocked the rollback,
    is stashed or committed). Always False when ``restored`` is True: a checkout
    that was put back holds nothing."""

class MergeHalfAppliedError(GitError):
    """Git died PART-WAY through checking the merge out: some incoming files are
    already sitting in the target checkout, and no restore removes them.

    A sibling of `MergePreflightError`, never a subclass, because it falsifies
    that class's central claim — the working tree was never touched. Measured
    cause (git 2.55.0, both `--no-ff` and `--squash`): a **required** clean/smudge
    filter that fails. git materializes the incoming paths in index order, so the
    ones sorting before the filtered path are written to the working tree and the
    ones after it are not; git then rolls the INDEX back and exits, leaving the
    written files behind as UNTRACKED. Nothing in the failure's own shape
    distinguishes it from a genuine pre-flight refusal: no unmerged stages, no
    MERGE_HEAD, and — because `git diff --quiet HEAD --` cannot see untracked
    files — a tree that reads clean against HEAD.

    That residue is why this is a type and not a message tweak. It blocks the
    NEXT merge as an untracked-overwrite pre-flight refusal, so a run told its
    checkout was unchanged fails the same way on every resume, over paths the
    error never named.

    The residue has TWO axes and they are not interchangeable. An incoming path
    the target did not already track lands as an untracked file, which no restore
    reaches. An incoming path it DID track is modified in place, which a
    path-scoped `git checkout HEAD --` over exactly the attributed paths does
    undo. So the tracked axis is repaired and the untracked axis is reported, and
    the class carries one field for each — plus ``rewritten``, naming the tracked
    paths the repair covered (or failed to).

    Attribution, on both axes, is a per-path AND of two proofs: the path changed
    during the merge window (a before/after delta, never an absolute reading) AND
    the merge could have written it (the branch's incoming set). Each proof rules
    out the misattribution the other cannot: the delta keeps the operator's
    pre-existing strays and edits out, the intersection keeps their CONCURRENT
    writes out — an edit landing on a bystander path mid-merge was once swept
    into a repo-wide "the tree is dirty now" reading and destroyed by the
    repo-wide reset riding on it. Two ceilings remain, per path: a path already
    dirty before the merge stays unattributable, and a concurrent write to a
    path INSIDE the incoming set is indistinguishable from git's and is restored
    with it.

    ``paths`` carries the untracked residue — what the operator still has to
    clear. Deliberately not cleaned: `reset --hard` and `merge --abort` both
    leave untracked files alone (measured), and deleting them is precisely the
    destruction #619's before-snapshot exists to prevent — the attribution
    proves git wrote *a* path, not that the bytes there are git's.

    ``rewritten`` carries the tracked residue — the paths whose restore
    ``restored`` reports on, so a failed repair can be finished by hand
    path-scoped (`git checkout HEAD -- <path>`) instead of by the repo-wide
    reset whose blast radius the attribution exists to avoid.

    ``restored`` says whether the TRACKED half was rolled back, and is True when
    there was none to roll back. It matters because it changes the operator's
    FIRST step, exactly as its namesake on `MergeCommitRefusedError` does: a
    checkout still holding incoming content on tracked paths refuses the next
    merge over those paths ("Your local changes would be overwritten"), so a resume
    attempted before restoring it fails on the tree rather than on whatever stopped
    the checkout.

    An empty ``paths`` with ``restored`` True is still this class and not
    `MergePreflightError`. The checkout ends up in the same place, but the CAUSE
    the operator has to act on is a different one — something stopped git mid-write,
    not a target-state clash — and sending them to clear a clash that does not
    exist is the #619 defect this taxonomy exists to prevent."""

    The terminal arm of the classification, present so a probe failure can never
    impersonate a verdict. Unwrapped, the probe's raise escapes between the
    failed merge and its cleanup — stranding a started `--no-ff` mid-merge with
    MERGE_HEAD set — and lands in the caller's content-conflict arm wearing a
    probe error's text, with a remedy that is fiction here. Degraded SILENTLY
    instead, the empty reading routes to `MergePreflightError`, whose
    load-bearing clause — the working tree was never touched — the dead probe
    can no longer back. Both neighbours state what was measured; this class
    states that the measurement is missing.

    Reachable from the corner where nothing else answered. Over dead RESIDUE
    readings, unmerged stages (conflict) and MERGE_HEAD (commit refused) are read
    independently, so either still claims its own class — only the choice
    between "refused before starting" and "failed part-way through checkout"
    rests on that reading, and with it gone the honest answer is neither. The
    index and merge-state readings can die in the same window (#619): a dead
    index reading surrenders every class resting on "did not collide" —
    commit-refused and half-applied as much as pre-flight, since a state it
    cannot rule a conflict out of must not be dressed as either — and a dead
    merge-state reading additionally skips the abort it gates, with the
    message saying so, because uncertainty never authorizes a repair write.
    The squash replay reading joins from the far side of a merge that
    SUCCEEDED: with `allow_empty_squash`'s staged-result reading dead, neither
    the no-op return nor a result to commit can be claimed, so nothing is
    committed, nothing is reset, and the message names the dead reading.

    No repair rides on it: `reset --hard` stays gated on a PROVEN
    tracked-residue attribution, because uncertainty must not be what authorizes
    rewriting the operator's checkout. Their own `git status` is not degraded —
    the message carries the probe's failure alongside git's own and sends them

    `subprocess.run` *before* any return code exists — a timeout (#156), a
    spawn-level OSError (#343), and a strict-decode fault on the child's output
    (#377) — so left uncaught any of them would bypass every `except GitError`
    guard and crash the run. All are translated here into the GitError taxonomy
    — observation guards degrade, unguarded paths fail typed — with the two that
    mean the binary never answered marked as `GitSpawnError` and
    `GitTimeoutError` for the callers that must distinguish an environment fault
    from git refusing. The decode fault carries no class of its own: git ran and
    returned, so it is a fact about the repository's bytes, not about the host.

    The decode fault is real, not theoretical: POSIX filenames are arbitrary
    bytes, and while `core.quotePath` C-quotes them to ASCII for ordinary
    porcelain, `-z` disables that quoting (`dirty_paths`, `branch_incoming_paths`,
    `commit_paths`), `worktree list --porcelain` never applied it, and `git diff`
    emits file *content* verbatim (`capture_diff`) — so one latin-1 file is
    enough. Translating is deliberately all this does; making such paths usable
    (`errors="surrogateescape"`) is a separate call, since surrogates would then
    flow into the UTF-8 journal and JSON writes downstream.

    `binary=True` skips the decode entirely and hands back the raw
    `CompletedProcess[bytes]` — see `git_bytes`, the public accessor for it.

    Every git child runs with `LC_ALL=C` so messages stay stable English: the one
    place that inspects git *text* rather than a return code — `safe_rollback`'s
    benign "pathspec did not match" tolerance — must not misread a translated
    message under a localized git (#236). Merged last so it wins over both the
    inherited environment and any explicit `env` (the `_git_env` callers' throwaway
    `GIT_INDEX_FILE` / synthetic identity vars are preserved by the spread).

    `prepared_update` is the one interactive mode.  It owns the complete
    ``update-ref --stdin`` process lifecycle: start, queue, prepare, the caller's
    lock-held validation, commit/abort, bounded pipe reads, and termination.  It
    never returns or embeds the child's output, because ref names and object IDs
    in that protocol are migration authority rather than operator diagnostics.

    `timeout_s` overrides the module bound for this one call — the interactive
    callers' seam (#390): a TUI render or install's best-effort probe keeps its
    own short deadline while standing inside the chokepoint."""

    * **the returncode is an answer, not a fault.** The `CompletedProcess` is
      returned whatever the rc, never `check=True`: `git config --get` of an unset
      key exits 1, and that *is* the reply. Callers branch on `returncode`.

    Standing inside the chokepoint is what buys the rest: the `LC_ALL=C` pin so
    git's message text stays stable English (#236), and the `_git_timeout_s` bound
    the engine sets from `limits.git_timeout_s` (#156) — or, for an interactive
    caller whose surface must not appear hung, the shorter per-call `timeout_s`

    Refusing an unparseable answer is the point rather than a fallback: both callers
    use this to gate something they must not do optimistically — abort a run, or make
    a PERMANENT repo-format change — so the failure it must not have is the generous
    one. A git that will not say what it is does not clear the floor.

    The minor must END at a delimiter, which is what keeps that promise against
    trailing garbage: without the lookahead `git version 2.34broken` reads as 2.34

    callers test `is not None` and never truthiness (an empty-but-present answer is a
    refusal, not a pass).

    Ablating either leaves the other's test green (#464), so they need separate seams

    `git version` is safe against any path: it does no repository setup, so it exits
    0 where `rev-parse` fatals 128 on a malformed `.git/config` — the probe answers
    for the git BINARY, never for the repo. A non-zero rc is therefore already a

    Raises `GitError` untouched when git could not be run at all — absent or
    unspawnable as `GitSpawnError`, hung as `GitTimeoutError`. That is a different
    fact from "too old" and each caller dispositions it differently, so it is
    deliberately not folded in here.

    `timeout_s` is the #390 per-call seam, forwarded verbatim: the CLI gates keep
    the engine bound, while a caller that must not stall — the TUI guard, on the

    (`refused_integration_residue`) guards a re-arm over a hook's OUTPUT,
    and an absence has none to seal — while the operator's one way to clear

    must be this repository's, clean, and at the gitlink (or, for a captured

    ``submodule.<name>.ignore = all``, under which ``git diff`` — worktree

    For a captured submodule the commit no longer holds as a gitlink: a blob

    as repo-relative posix paths — the listing behind the bundle path's
    artifact-only receipt (DW-273) and its attempt-start snapshot.

    `None` when the receipt cannot be consulted at all: `artifact_dir` resolves
    outside `repo` (an artifacts dir configured beside the checkout holds nothing
    git in `repo` can list, and a pathspec that escapes the tree would be a git
    error rather than an answer), `artifact_dir` IS `repo` (a `.` pathspec would
    list every ignored file in the tree — `.venv`, caches — and accept the receipt
    trivially), or git refuses the listing (rc != 0). A `[]` is the OTHER answer —
    git ran and listed no ignored entry — and callers that relax a gate on this
    must treat both as "no receipt". A `GitError` propagates: the chokepoint's
    environment faults (timeout, spawn) are the caller's to escalate, exactly as
    they are for the ordinary proof-of-work probe.

    ONLY `!!` records count. `status --ignored` also lists the tracked (` M`) and
    untracked-not-ignored (`??`) records under the dir, and those are exactly what
    the ordinary probe already measured — and, for the bundle's own spec, already
    EXCLUDED. Under the `bmad-loop init` default layout (`_bmad-output/` is not
    gitignored) a bundle whose only residue is its own spec's status flip or its
    own newly written spec would otherwise be accepted on a listing of one; the
    receipt exists for the gitignored layout alone, so it reads only what that
    layout produces.

    Why `status --ignored` and not a baseline diff: ignored paths never enter the
    index, so there is no commit to diff them against. The listing answers only
    "the artifacts dir holds ignored content under the code tree" — it cannot say
    which entry a session wrote, which is why :func:`artifact_dir_snapshot` and
    :func:`_artifact_dir_owned_entries` exist: the ATTEMPT's own start-of-attempt
    fingerprint of this listing is the baseline ignored paths otherwise lack.
    `--untracked-files=all` makes git enumerate the individual files inside an
    ignored directory rather than collapsing the directory to one record, so the
    entries are files that can be fingerprinted, not prefixes.

    `-z` bytes, decoded with `os.fsdecode`, for the reason `dirty_paths` and
    `commit_paths` read them so: ordinary porcelain C-quotes a non-ASCII name
    under `core.quotePath`, and a quoted record is not a path this module can
    `stat`. Reads `stdout` ALONE, for the reason :func:`path_clean` spells out:
    `status` exits 0 while still writing advisories to stderr, and against a
    merged stream that chatter would be one phantom entry — enough, on its own,

    (e.g. the frontmatter-status reconcile) under them doesn't register as real
    implementation work. Mirrors
    `attempt_dirty`'s exclusion. Default `()` keeps the unscoped behavior.

    `baseline_untracked` is the untracked-file snapshot taken when the baseline
    was recorded; when given, those files already existed before the session ran
    and are subtracted, so pre-session residue (e.g. an earlier halt's saved
    intent-gap patch, which `_protected_relpaths` shields from every reset) can

    the launch-time snapshot cannot establish whether an untracked file appeared
    before or after that later commit. The default preserves every established
    caller and exact-baseline proof.

    `None` means count EVERY untracked file — deliberately the *opposite* of

    toward "nothing to remove" (never delete a file it cannot prove this attempt
    created). Keep it that way.

    Every non-zero `git diff` result reads as "changed" here, INCLUDING a refusal
    (rc 128 — an unresolvable baseline, a repo git will not read). That is the

    wildmatch metacharacters — but the harm here runs the other way: an over-matching
    exclusion HIDES a diff instead of exposing a file. `_changes_since` (the

    CLEAN when it changed — the same false "no changes" that a dev attempt's dirtiness
    check exists to prevent (#423 item 3).

    It also realigns this half with :func:`_path_under_any`, the Python `startswith`

    differently about what "under the artifact dir" means. Literal is the reading
    `_path_under_any` already implements, which is why fixing the git half is the right
    direction and not a coin flip.

    `*` and `?` both cross `/` here — `FNM_PATHNAME` is opt-in via `:(glob)`, which this
    never sets — but only a `*` reaches a sibling DIRECTORY's contents; a same-length
    `[…]`/`?` collision reaches a sibling FILE only, because the pathspec has to match

    rollback step touches at all (`reset --hard` skips it, and this module never runs
    `git clean`). A caller that reasons only over "tracked vs untracked" silently
    files every ignored path under whichever branch it wrote last.

    Only the output's EMPTINESS is read, never its text: `core.quotePath` mangles
    non-ASCII names, and a tracked-but-deleted-from-the-worktree path still lists (the
    index entry outlives the file), which is exactly the state a caller must not
    mistake for "not git's". Not `--error-unmatch`, which reports "not tracked" and
    "git blew up" with the same non-zero rc; not `check-ignore`, which answers whether
    a RULE matches rather than whether git owns the path — a `git add -f`'d file under
    an ignore rule has to read tracked here.

    Reads `stdout` ALONE, not `_git`'s stdout+stderr merge: `ls-files` exits 0 while
    still writing to stderr — a `core.fsmonitor` hook that cannot exec, an unknown
    `core.fsyncMethod` — and against the merged stream that chatter reads as an index
    entry for a path git does not track at all. The failure is silent and inverted
    (untracked answers "tracked"), so callers act on the opposite of the truth. The
    error path keeps the merge, where stderr is the only informative half.

    The pathspec is forced LITERAL, because git reads a positional operand as a
    PATHSPEC and not as a path: `[`, `]`, `*` and `?` in ``rel`` are wildmatch
    metacharacters, so a probe for an ABSENT path answers True the moment some OTHER
    tracked path happens to match the glob. The error is one-directional —
    `match_pathspec_item` compares literally before it falls through to fnmatch, so a
    genuinely tracked path never reads untracked — and it runs toward the answer that
    authorizes leaving a file alone, which is how a harvested ledger under an
    operator-named `implementation_artifacts` (`bmadconfig._resolve` takes that key
    verbatim, metacharacters and all) outlived the rollback that discarded the code it
    described. Not the global `--literal-pathspecs` / `GIT_LITERAL_PATHSPECS` form,
    which would also disarm the `:(exclude)` magic `worktree_clean`, `_changes_since`
    and `attempt_dirty` are built on; the per-operand prefix is scoped to this call. It
    costs the callers nothing: that same literal comparison is what matches a DIRECTORY
    prefix, so `_bmad/render` still lists everything beneath it (`cmd_validate`'s
    render-tracked warning), and it additionally disarms a ``rel`` that itself begins
    with `:`, which git would otherwise parse as magic and answer the empty set for.
    Stable across the supported range, `GIT_FLOOR` to current;
    below a version that understands the prefix it would read as a literal FILENAME,
    match nothing and answer False, which is the one direction that authorizes a
    delete.

    Raises GitError like every other probe in this module. Callers inside a rollback
    `finally` catch it and degrade toward leaving the file alone: uncertainty must
    never authorize a delete. The message keeps the BARE ``rel``: the operator's path is
    its informative half and the magic prefix is our own plumbing.

    Three live callers, all reached through this one chokepoint: `git.render-tracked`
    (`cmd_validate`), `_ledger_is_gits_to_restore` (the harvest revert) and

    """Which of three states repo-relative posix ``rel`` holds in the index: absent from
    it, a tracked regular FILE, or a tracked DIRECTORY prefix.

    The distinction :func:`path_tracked` deliberately does not draw. Its literal
    pathspec matches a directory prefix too — that is load-bearing there, which is why
    `_bmad/render` answers True for the whole tree beneath it — so a caller that must
    know *which* of the three it holds cannot get it from that boolean.

    ONE `ls-files` spawn answers all three, because the pathspec's literal comparison is
    itself what separates them: a tracked file lists exactly the name asked for, a
    tracked directory lists the entries BENEATH it (never the directory's own name), and
    a path with no index entry lists nothing. So the empty set is "untracked", the
    singleton `{rel}` is "file", and any other non-empty set is "dir". A D/F-conflicted
    index — one name carrying both a file entry and entries beneath it — therefore
    answers "dir", which degrades toward substituting per-file patterns for what
    provisioning actually wrote: still a shield over our own files, and wrong in the
    spare-a-pattern direction rather than the leaking one.

    The worktree git-add shield is what needs the three apart, because they want three
    different treatments (#392, #484). Measured, git 2.55.0:

    * An exclude pattern naming a tracked regular FILE suppresses NOTHING. git consults
      ignore rules only for untracked paths, so `git add -A` stages a modification to it
      regardless. The pattern's only effect is to make the file answer
      `ls-files -ci --exclude-standard`, i.e. read as tracked-and-ignored — which is a
      state repo-hygiene gates reject, and how a shield meant to keep the orchestrator's
      files OUT of a story commit came to block one instead. The pattern is dropped.
    * The same pattern over a tracked DIRECTORY really does hide new children, and no
      pattern shape keeps that AND clears the `-ci` report: `dir/*`, `dir/**` and a
      trailing negation all measured identical to `dir`, because gitignore cannot
      re-include anything under an excluded parent. That measurement stands; the verdict
      it once carried — keep the dir pattern, accept the report — is REVERSED (#484).
      Over a tracked directory the protection is already mostly inert, since
      modifications to tracked children stage regardless, so the pattern was buying only
      new-child coverage at the price of a false tracked-and-ignored report across the
      whole tree. It is replaced by one pattern per untracked file provisioning wrote.
      The residual — a session-created NEW child under a tracked tool directory can be
      staged — is accepted, and matches the project's own decision to track that tree.
    * An UNTRACKED path keeps its pattern unchanged: full protection, and nothing
      beneath it can answer `-ci` in the first place.

    `-z` and the BYTES accessor, unlike :func:`path_tracked`. This reads the output's
    TEXT rather than only its emptiness, so that function's reason for never looking —
    `core.quotePath` mangling non-ASCII names — becomes this one's problem instead.
    NUL-delimited output is never quoted, and comparing `os.fsencode(rel)` keeps a POSIX
    name that is undecodable in the locale codec comparable rather than raising (#377).

    The pathspec is forced LITERAL for BOTH directions of the metacharacter hazard, not
    just the sibling's one. Reading the text already refuses a glob's false positive on
    an ABSENT ``rel``: the stray match comes back under the NEIGHBOUR'S name, which is
    not the name asked for, so the set differs whatever the pathspec. What needs
    `:(literal)` is the opposite direction — when ``rel`` carries `[`, `]`, `*` or `?`
    and a glob-colliding neighbour is tracked too, a bare pathspec returns BOTH names.
    The set then exceeds the singleton and a genuine tracked FILE reads "dir", so the
    shield substitutes patterns for a tree it never wrote, for any project whose hook
    config or skill tree carries a metacharacter.

    Raises GitError like every other probe in this module; the shield's caller degrades
    by KEEPING the pattern it already holds, since a leaked seed file in a story commit
    is the worse of the two failures."""

    which end of the checkin/checkout round trip the file on disk sits at, and there is
    no answer that holds: under `core.autocrlf=true` — Git for Windows' system default,
    which the suite deliberately leaves reachable — a freshly checked-out board is CRLF
    while one an editor or a byte-writing tool left is LF, and git calls the tree clean
    either way. Measured both ways at git 2.55.0: a baseline read raw refuses the CRLF
    checkout, a baseline read through the smudge refuses the LF one, and the two
    failures are the same mistake pointing opposite directions. Hashing both sides
    through the CLEAN filter collapses that distinction, because it is precisely the
    distinction git itself does not draw.

    What it does NOT collapse is content: an operator's added row survives cleaning and
    still answers False, which is the only discrimination the caller wants.

    Git holds a path in two places and `commit_paths` writes both: `git add` copies the
    WORKING TREE into the commit and overwrites the INDEX in place. A staged version
    distinct from both HEAD and ``data`` therefore exists nowhere afterwards — not in
    the commit, which took the working tree, and not on disk — so proving only the
    working tree is not proving the carry destroys nothing. Measured: with the operator's
    edit staged and the working tree restored, the carry commits, the row is absent from
    HEAD and from disk, and the tree reads clean, the bytes surviving only as a dangling
    blob (#618).

    True when the index holds HEAD's own content, or already holds ``data``, or holds
    no entry for a path HEAD does not carry either — the first loses nothing git cannot
    still reach, the second is the write itself, and the third is empty in both places
    at once. Unmerged stages raise rather than answer: a half-resolved index is not a
    state this can prove anything about.

    An absent entry is NOT by itself "nothing to overwrite", which is why HEAD is
    consulted before accepting one. With HEAD carrying the path, no index entry is a
    staged DELETION — `git rm --cached`, the operator untracking a board they are
    about to gitignore, which is a shape this project documents rather than an exotic
    one — and the carry's `git add` restores the entry, leaving that intent nowhere:
    not in HEAD, which never had it, and not in the index that just lost it. Measured.

    CONTENT is the whole of what this proves, and that ceiling is deliberate.
    ``ls-files -s`` reports the entry's MODE too and this reads only the oid beside
    it, so an operator who stages nothing but an exec-bit flip
    (``update-index --chmod=+x``) leaves the blob identical, is approved here, and has
    that staged mode reset by the carry's ``git add``. 100644/100755 is the only pair
    that can reach it — a symlink entry (120000) carries a different blob, which the
    oid compare already catches — so the exposure is exactly an exec bit on a YAML
    data file that nothing reads and nothing runs. Widening the proof to index
    metadata no workflow here sets would protect nothing and hand the carry one more
    way to refuse an ordinary board. A caller must not read this as "the index entry
    is untouched"; it says "the index holds no content this write would lose".

    """True when `git add` would REFUSE ``path`` for being ignored — i.e. an ignore
    rule matches it AND git does not already track it (#577).

    Both halves matter, and `check-ignore` answers both in one call: it consults the
    INDEX unless told not to (`--no-index` exists precisely to turn that off), so a
    tracked file under a matching rule reads NOT ignored here — rc 1 — which is
    exactly what `git add` does with it. That asymmetry is the #392 one seen from the
    other side: a rule over a tracked regular file suppresses nothing, because git
    consults ignore rules only for untracked paths. A probe that read the RULE alone
    would answer "ignored" for a `git add -f`'d board and drop it from a commit git
    would have taken. Measured, git 2.55.0.

    Takes an absolute `Path` rather than a repo-relative rel like its two siblings
    above, because its caller holds a CONFIGURED path (`ProjectPaths.sprint_status`,
    resolved out of the operator's `_bmad/bmm/config.yaml`) rather than a git-derived
    relpath, and the answer has to be about the same rel :func:`commit_paths` will
    derive from that same `Path`. Deriving it twice in two modules is how the two
    drift apart. Out-of-repo answers False for the same reason `commit_paths` skips
    such a path: there is nothing here to omit from a commit that will not contain it.

    The one probe in this module that CANNOT force a literal operand: `check-ignore`
    parses pathspec magic and then rejects it outright — `:(literal)x` exits 128 with
    "pathspec magic not supported by this command" (measured, git 2.55.0) — so the
    hardening `path_tracked` documents at length is unavailable. It is also not
    needed for the glob half: gitignore matching makes the PATTERN the wildmatch and
    the pathname a literal, so `[`, `]`, `*` and `?` in ``rel`` are inert (verified
    against a repo holding both `d[a]/b.yaml` and `da/b.yaml` under a `da/` rule —
    the metacharacter path correctly reads not-ignored).

    The leading `./` is what stands in for it, and it is load-bearing: magic is
    recognized only on an operand that STARTS with `:`, so a prefix that is a no-op
    as a path is enough to make git read the whole rel as a pathname. Without it a
    ``rel`` beginning with `:` fails TWO ways, not one, and the quiet way is the
    reason this is not merely cosmetic (both measured, git 2.55.0):

    - UNSUPPORTED magic (`:(literal)`, `:(icase)`, `:!`, `:^`) exits 128, which
      surfaces as `GitError` and degrades to "not ignored" — a gitignored board then
      stays in `confirm`'s operand list and `git add` refuses the WHOLE list with it,
      losing the spec and park-record writes that #577 exists to keep.
    - SUPPORTED magic (`:(top)`, `:/`) is accepted, and git answers about the path
      the magic DENOTES rather than the file named on disk: `:(top)board.yaml` reads
      rc 0 whenever a plain `board.yaml` is ignored, even though nothing matches the
      real file. That is a silent wrong answer in the drop direction — `confirm`
      would omit a perfectly committable board and never commit its advance.

    Verified that `./` costs neither contract above: the index consultation still
    reads a tracked-and-ignored board as not-ignored, and `d[a]/f.md` still reads
    literally beside an ignored `da/`.

    Raises GitError like every other probe in this module. Its caller degrades by
    treating the path as NOT ignored, which keeps it in the commit — the behavior
    before this function existed, and the direction that cannot lose a write."""

    silently destroy an attempt's in-progress work. The snapshot survives

    Captured through a throwaway temp index so the real index and working tree
    are left untouched: seed the temp index from HEAD, ``add -u`` the tracked
    edits/deletions, then stage only the untracked files *this run* created —
    ``untracked_files(repo)`` minus ``baseline_untracked`` (the snapshot taken
    when the baseline was captured). This mirrors :func:`safe_rollback`'s scope
    exactly: the snapshot holds precisely what the reset would destroy and never
    a pre-existing user untracked file. When ``baseline_untracked`` is ``None`` (a
    pre-upgrade/resumed run with no snapshot) no untracked file is staged — matching
    :func:`safe_rollback`, which then deletes none — so tracked edits are still
    parked but untracked files are left untouched. Ignored files are excluded
    throughout unless a caller supplies a trusted literal ``force_include`` path.
    Recovery uses that narrow exception for an attempt-bound spec whose durable
    byte snapshot proves the child changed a baseline-untracked or ignored file;
    ``git add -f`` then parks the child bytes before recovery restores the input.
    The caller must validate those paths as trusted regular files first. A tree is
    written and ``commit-tree``'d parented at HEAD
    under a synthetic ``bmad-loop`` identity so the snapshot commit succeeds even
    when no local/global git ``user.name``/``user.email`` is configured, then
    ``ref_name`` is pointed at the result. Compares only against HEAD — committed
    work above baseline is already parked by :func:`preserve_commits`, so this
    captures exactly what is not yet committed.

    Returns ``ref_name`` on success, or ``None`` when the tree is clean relative
    to HEAD (nothing to preserve — the intended non-destructive uncommitted-revert
    case). Raises :class:`GitError` on any git failure — the raise *surfaces* the
    capture failure so the caller can decide. Since #340 the recovery ref is a
    gate, not a safety net: the worktree caller's old best-effort "journal the
    failure and proceed" contract is gone, and a plain rollback now refuses to
    reset past work it could not park (only a re-drive, whose caller contract
    forbids pausing, still journals and lets the human-directed reset run).

    The three reads whose text IS the answer — ``write-tree``,
    ``rev-parse <head>^{tree}`` and ``commit-tree`` — take stdout ALONE
    (``_git_out``, #442). Git exits 0 while still warning on stderr, and against
    the merged stream all three answer a warning-suffixed "sha": the
    ``tree == head_tree`` comparison then reads unequal on a tree identical to
    HEAD, and ``update-ref`` is handed a non-ref. Because of the gate above, that
    leaves a host whose git config warns with no working rollback at all. The
    rc-only ``_git_env`` calls stay on the merge — they spend their output on a
    raise and never read it as a value.

    Reverts tracked changes to `baseline` (the dev attempt's commits/edits),
    then removes only untracked files that appeared since `baseline` — i.e.
    files this run created. Untracked files already present at baseline, every
    ignored file, and anything under a `keep` dir are preserved. The orchestrator
    therefore never runs `git clean -fd`, so it can't eat a user's pre-existing
    untracked work. `baseline_untracked` is the snapshot taken when the baseline
    was captured; None (a pre-upgrade run with no snapshot) removes nothing.

    `preserve` is repo-relative posix dir prefixes (the BMAD artifact folders)
    whose *tracked* content must survive the hard reset — e.g. a frozen spec the
    resolve workflow just corrected, or a sentinel it deliberately deleted. The
    `git reset --hard` would otherwise revert them (keep only guards untracked
    deletion). We snapshot the current tree with `git stash create`, enumerate
    tracked deletions inside the preserved prefixes, reset, then restore the
    snapshot's present paths and replay its deletions. If the snapshot or deletion
    inventory cannot be read we raise *before* the reset rather than proceed with
    an incomplete restore: that would revert exactly what `preserve` names, and it
    would do so silently. Untracked artifacts need no special handling: the reset
    leaves them alone and the cleanup below skips `keep` dirs.

    `policy.toml` (the operator's orchestration config) is *always* restored,
    regardless of `preserve`. It lives inside the kept `.bmad-loop` dir but is
    *tracked*, so a plain `git reset --hard` would silently revert it — an
    uncommitted edit (e.g. a freshly enabled `scm.rollback_on_failure`, gone
    before it ever takes effect) or a change committed after `baseline`. `keep`
    only guards untracked deletion, not tracked reverts. We can't ride the stash
    snapshot for it: `git stash create` emits an empty snapshot for a clean tree,
    so a policy change living in a *commit* (with no other working-tree dirt)
    would skip the restore and be lost. Instead we read policy.toml's on-disk
    content before the reset and write it straight back after — independent of
    the snapshot, covering both the uncommitted and committed cases.

    Before either stash creation or reset, every path needed by the later
    untracked cleanup is canonicalized into a confined plan, including its prune
    bounds. Resolution uncertainty raises ``RollbackPreflightError`` with the
    filesystem fault as its cause, so the caller can pause while the tree is
    untouched; the post-reset cleanup consumes the plan without resolving again.

    That "un-canonicalized" promise is why this reader does NOT go through `_git_out`,
    which returns `stdout.strip()`. A worktree registered at a path with TRAILING
    WHITESPACE — `<mount> ` — came back stripped to `<mount>`, which compares EQUAL to
    a unit's own mount path, so the occupancy guard exempted a foreign checkout as if
    it were the unit's own. The ref then moved under a live foreign worktree, its tree
    went spuriously dirty, and `worktree add` failed anyway: exactly the harm the guard
    exists to prevent, WITH the guard present. The error can only go that unsafe way —
    `safe_segment` rstrips `". "` from every segment we compose, so our own mount path
    can never end in whitespace and a spurious REFUSE is unreachable.

    Only the single trailing `\n` that `for-each-ref` frames each record with is
    removed, never arbitrary whitespace; an empty answer (`""` or a bare `"\n"`) still
    means "no worktree has it attached" and returns `None`.

    Accepted bound: `_run_git` runs with `text=True` (universal newlines), so a
    registered path ending in `\r` arrives already translated and stays
    indistinguishable from one that does not. Closing that needs a bytes read, which is
    out of scope here.

    Background: with engine `editor_mode = "per_worktree"`, a competing Editor
    can leak asset writes (`.cs.meta` GUIDs, asmdef auto-edits) into the *main*
    checkout. The merge then aborts pre-flight ("local changes / untracked files
    would be overwritten"). Those leaked copies are Editor-generated duplicates of
    content already committed on `branch`, so cleaning them is safe — the merge
    re-creates the canonical versions.

    Guard: only paths that lie within the branch's incoming set are cleaned. A dirty
    path *outside* that set is real operator work and is never touched. Whether it also
    BLOCKS the merge is decided per path by the INDEX column, not by trackedness
    (#618): the merge writes only paths that differ between `target` and `branch`, so
    a stray git has nothing staged for — untracked, or tracked and edited in the
    working tree only — can be neither overwritten by the merge nor written into its
    commit. Measured on both topologies and both strategies: rc 0, the edit survives
    uncommitted, and it is absent from the resulting commit. A STAGED stray is the
    real hazard, and it is one under both strategies — `merge --no-ff` refuses it
    outright, and so does `merge --squash` against a diverged target; only a
    fast-forwardable `--squash` accepts it, and that one FOLDS the operator's staged
    work into the story's commit.

    ``protected`` names repo-relative posix paths the ORCHESTRATOR itself commits
    after the merge, and a stray among them blocks whatever its index column says.
    The merge's own inertness does not protect them, because the merge is not what
    would commit them: ``commit_paths`` runs `git add -- :(literal)<path>` and then a
    pathspec commit, so ANY working-tree change to a named path is committed no
    matter who wrote it. The run's carry bookkeeping passes the sprint board and the
    deferred-work ledger through that call — ``_carry_board_advance``
    unconditionally — so an operator's private unstaged edit to one of those files
    lands in git history under a `chore(sprint-status): carry ...` message, leaving
    the tree clean and no trace of the substitution. The blast radius is strictly
    SAME-PATH: `git commit -- <pathspec>` is implicitly `--only`, so dirt on any
    other path is never swept in, which is why this list is a set of exact paths and
    not a policy. Default empty — the wiring is the caller's.

    ``on_tolerated``, when given, is called once with the sorted list of stray paths
    the guard walked past — the exact complement of the blocking ones within the
    strays, and the mirror of the returned ``cleaned`` list — so a merge that
    proceeded over operator dirt leaves the same kind of trace as one that cleaned a
    leak. Not called when there are no such paths.

    Neither of those is a substitute: a merge that dies part-way through checkout
    rolls its INDEX back but leaves the files it already wrote in the working
    tree, and an untracked file is by definition absent from HEAD and from the
    index, so both diffs read CLEAN over it. Sampled before and after the merge
    and differenced, so the answer is "git wrote this", not "this is here" — the
    same before/after discipline the tracked half uses, and for the same reason:
    an absolute post-merge reading would attribute the operator's own strays to
    git.

    `--exclude-standard` deliberately keeps ignored files out. They are not
    residue this can act on: an ignored path is invisible to the next merge's
    pre-flight too, so it cannot produce the resume failure this probe exists to
    name, and reporting one would send the operator after a file their own
    `.gitignore` says is theirs.

    NUL-delimited, and read through `_run_git` directly for the same reason
    `capture_diff` does: this needs stdout VERBATIM and stderr for the error text,
    which no single `_git*` wrapper hands back together. `ls-files --others`
    applies `core.quotePath` C-quoting to non-ASCII paths, and a line-splitting
    read with `.strip()` also eats leading and trailing spaces from a filename —
    harmless to the delta, since both samples would be mangled identically, but
    not to the ANSWER: these names are handed to the operator with an instruction
    to clear them, and a quoted or trimmed name is one they cannot act on. Two
    distinct paths can also strip to the same string, which would let a
    pre-existing stray mask a real materialization. `dirty_paths` and
    `branch_incoming_paths` already read path lists this way.

    Taking stdout verbatim also covers the #442 advisory hazard the merged stream
    has: git writes warnings to stderr at rc 0, and against `_git`'s merge a
    warning line would become a phantom path in the set.

    RAISES on a failed read rather than degrading the way its neighbours
    `_index_unmerged` and `_merge_in_progress` do (each hands back an unread
    marker), and the difference is position, not importance: this is one half
    of a PAIR, so a silent empty set is not a neutral answer — an empty BEFORE
    against a real AFTER reports every stray already in the checkout as
    something git just wrote, and the message tells the operator to clear what
    it names. Failing the merge outright is the smaller harm, and the
    before-read that would produce that asymmetry runs while nothing has been
    mutated yet.

    That argument covers only the BEFORE reading, which is why the AFTER reading
    goes through `_merge_residue`: post-merge, this same raise would bypass the

    Two ceilings survive, stated rather than patched around. A path already
    dirty BEFORE the merge stays unattributable — per path now, not per tree —
    because the delta cannot say which bytes are whose. And a concurrent edit

    `ls-files -u` discriminates across the whole matrix — empty for every

    Returns the tree the squash leg STAGED before its own ``git commit`` sealed
    it (``write-tree``, read after ``merge --squash`` resolved and before any
    hook ran) — ``None`` on the other legs and on a no-op replay. That commit
    re-reads the index after ``pre-commit``, so a target hook can rewrite and
    re-add an incoming path into the commit itself, where no index or checkout
    probe can tell hook output from the resolved merge (#796 review); the
    receipt-owned caller proves the sealed commit's tree against this value
    instead. The `--no-ff` merge commit is written from the tree git already
    resolved, and `ff` creates no commit, so neither leg has the exposure.
    Expects the target checkout to be clean; the worktree pipeline reconciles
    Editor-induced dirt first via `clean_incoming_collisions`.

    A failure git raised at PRE-FLIGHT — an untracked file the merge would
    overwrite, a staged change on an incoming path, a file/directory shape clash,
    an `--ff-only` target that cannot fast-forward — never started a merge and
    left the tree untouched, so it raises the `MergePreflightError` subclass with
    git's own text passed through verbatim (#619). "git said no" is not enough to
    earn that class, though; see the fourth state below, where git says no after
    having already written part of the incoming tree.

    Four measured states, one terminal fallback, and no one probe orders them.
    `_index_unmerged` leads and answers
    CONTENT: unmerged stages mean the merge ran and collided (raised as
    `MergeConflictError`, so the caller never has to read "bare GitError" as
    "conflict"). Its absence does not
    mean the merge never ran — a `--no-ff` whose commit was refused leaves a
    cleanly merged index, no unmerged stages, and MERGE_HEAD set (measured for
    `pre-merge-commit`, `commit-msg`, and an unsignable `commit.gpgsign`).
    MERGE_HEAD is the second question and parts those two, which is why it is read
    BEFORE the abort that erases it rather than only to decide whether to abort at
    all.

    MERGE_HEAD alone would be wrong in the other direction — the error the old
    "no MERGE_HEAD created" framing made — because a conflicted `--squash` leaves
    unmerged stages and no MERGE_HEAD. The squash MERGE INVOCATION cannot be
    commit-refused — `--squash` stops before committing by design (measured:
    rc 0 with a rejecting `pre-merge-commit` hook installed) — which is why only
    the `merge` leg reads MERGE_HEAD below. The LEG still reaches that state:
    it seals the staged result with its own plain `git commit`, where hooks and
    `commit.gpgsign` run like anywhere else, and a refusal there raises the same
    `MergeCommitRefusedError` — rolled back by `reset --hard HEAD` under the
    leg's pre-merge dirtiness gate rather than by an abort, and reported
    ``staged`` when that gate or the reset itself declines. The scope error to
    not repeat: "no hook runs" was measured of the merge invocation and is false
    of the leg, whose commit step is a second, later place git can say no.

    The fourth state is the one ALL THREE legs reach and no index probe can see:
    git dying part-way through the CHECKOUT. It leaves no unmerged stages, no
    MERGE_HEAD, and an index rolled back to HEAD, so every index- and HEAD-based
    reading calls it "refused before starting" and tells the operator their
    checkout is untouched — while the residue blocks the next merge's pre-flight,
    and the run fails identically on every resume over paths nothing named.
    `--ff-only` is not exempt, and the "it never starts a merge" premise this
    module used to carry was simply wrong: `--ff-only` declines the TOPOLOGY
    question only, and once the fast-forward is possible it checks the incoming
    tree out like any other merge (measured under a required smudge filter, all
    three strategies; HEAD does not move).

    The residue has two axes, which is why `_residue_snapshot` reads two probes
    and not one — and attribution on both is per PATH: a before/after delta
    intersected with the branch's incoming set, so neither the operator's
    pre-existing dirt nor a CONCURRENT edit of theirs landing during the merge
    window is ever called git's (the latter was the seventh mislabeled state: a
    repo-wide dirtiness boolean attributed the bystander edit to git and the
    repo-wide reset riding on it destroyed the edit — measured on all three
    legs). An incoming path the target did not already track lands as an
    UNTRACKED file, which no restore reaches — `reset --hard` and `merge --abort`
    both leave untracked files alone, and the latter exits 128 here besides, there
    being no merge to abort — so it is reported for the operator to clear. An
    incoming path the target DID track is modified in place, which a path-scoped
    `git checkout HEAD --` over exactly the attributed paths does undo.
    Either axis raises `MergeHalfAppliedError` — a SIBLING of `MergePreflightError`,
    since the two are mutually exclusive by construction (a refusal git makes at
    pre-flight is made before any file is written).

    The terminal fallback is a post-merge reading that itself FAILED. Every
    probe in that window degrades to an unread marker rather than raising —
    the raise would escape between the failed merge and its cleanup — and a
    verdict may only stand on readings that are live. Dead residue readings —
    either delta's, or the incoming set's that attributes them — surrender
    only the choice between "refused before starting" and "failed
    part-way" (conflict and commit-refused stand on their own measurements
    over it). A dead index reading surrenders every claim resting on "did not
    collide" — commit-refused, half-applied, and pre-flight alike. A dead
    merge-state reading additionally skips the abort, which that reading
    gates: `merge --abort` is a repair write, and uncertainty never
    authorizes one, so the message says none was attempted. Whatever cannot
    be claimed raises `MergeResidueUnreadError`, and every dead probe is
    named in the message whichever class raises.

    ``allow_empty_squash`` is recovery-only: re-running a squash that committed
    before a host loss stages nothing because the target already has the merged
    tree. That clean result confirms the replay without manufacturing an empty
    commit; ordinary squash calls keep commit failures strict.

    "the files differ", with empty stdout — so this leg is converted for the same

    frontmatter block.

    Same verified in-place line surgery as `set_frontmatter_status` (no YAML
    round-trip) so the spec's formatting, comments, and field order survive, and
    the same three-way return: True on a landed rewrite, False for **nothing to
    change** (no file, no frontmatter block, already at the value), and
    `FrontmatterWriteError` when the reader can see the key in a shape no line
    edit can safely move. "Comments survive" includes a trailing inline comment
    on the edited line itself: this shares `frontmatter._replace_value` with the
    status helper, so it inherits that renderer's certified-boundary carry (and
    its quote drop) rather than restating either.

    Unlike the status helper, a missing key is INSERTED as the block's last
    line: callers assert a field's value whether or not the skill wrote one
    (the patch-restore re-arm re-stamps ``baseline_revision``, which only the
    skill's step-03 writes). The insert is now gated on what `read_frontmatter`
    SEES rather than on a line-scan miss, which was a defect of its own — a
    quoted ``"baseline_revision":`` was missed by the scan and a second one
    appended, so the spec carried the key twice and the reader resolved the
    wrong one.

    Byte-preserving on the same terms as its sibling: ``read_bytes().decode`` in
    and bytes out, so a CRLF spec is not relaid to LF (nor an LF one to CRLF on
    Windows) by a write contracted to move one field. The INSERTED line takes the
    block's own ending, not a bare ``\\n``.

    Atomic on the same terms too (#379), and CONFINED on the same terms (#593):
    the spec-writer chokepoint rule — confined write in-tree, plain no-follow
    write for an artifacts folder configured outside the checkout — is stated
    once, in `frontmatter.set_frontmatter_status`, and this site implements it
    identically. ``confine_root`` is required for the reason it is required

    """Repo-relative posix paths the dev/bundle proof-of-work gate excludes from
    its probe (`_changes_since`, via `_verify_shared_gates.proof_of_work_probe`) —
    deliberately file-granular. Rollback protection is a separate concern: it
    builds its own list in `RecoveryFlow.protected_relpaths` against
    `workspace.root`, and `Engine._protected_relpaths` merely delegates there.
    Deliberately does NOT exclude `output_folder`:
    in the standard layout it is the parent directory of `implementation_artifacts`/
    `planning_artifacts`, so excluding it as a directory prefix would swallow those
    two folders' content right back out of view via the same git-pathspec prefix
    match this function exists to avoid.

    Excludes only what a session rewrites regardless of whether it did any real
    work: `paths.sprint_status` (every session advances it as routine bookkeeping)
    and the session's own claimed `spec_path` (so a bare frontmatter status flip on
    it doesn't count). Sibling content under the implementation/planning artifact
    dirs — the deferred-work ledger, other stories' specs — is deliberately left
    un-excluded, so a story whose entire authorized scope is ledger/spec
    reconciliation registers as real work instead of a permanent false "no changes
    since baseline".

    `restore_patch` (the task's latched intent-gap patch file, BMAD-METHOD #2564)
    is excluded too when set: the patch is untracked halt residue under the
    protected artifact dirs that survives every reset, so counting it would let a
    restore re-drive whose session produced nothing pass the gate on the patch
    file's mere presence — the gate must key on the APPLIED work (the tracked diff
    from baseline), not on the orchestrator-owned patch that carried it.

    `spec_path` comes from a session-reported (untrusted) `spec_file` string, so
    it is `.resolve()`d before deriving the relpath, same as `spec_within_roots`:
    an un-normalized `..`/`.` segment would still resolve to the real on-disk
    file (the OS resolves it), but as a raw string it wouldn't match git's own
    normalized path output, silently defeating this exclude and letting a bare
    status flip on the session's own spec count as real work.

    ``root`` is the tree the resulting pathspecs are relative to, and MUST be the
    same root the caller invokes git against — `paths.repo_root` for the
    proof-of-work gate, which is where the probe runs. REQUIRED, with no
    default: an implicit `paths.project` anchor is #716's own root cause, and the
    two roots collapse in every configuration but the `repo_root` override, so a
    defaulted caller would look correct everywhere it was tested and be wrong only
    on the one config that matters. Requiring it turns OMITTING the root into a
    type error; it does not police a WRONG one — ``root=paths.project`` type-checks
    cleanly and silently excludes nothing, which is the failure the next paragraph
    describes. The requirement buys a caller who must think about the root, not a
    checker that knows the right answer.

    The wrong-root symptom depends on topology. With disjoint sibling project and
    code roots, a code-root relative artifact path collapses to ``()`` and a
    project-root spelling is non-empty but still matches nothing in the code tree.
    In a nested monorepo both spellings are non-empty: omitting the project prefix
    can select a plausible outer-tree file instead of the nested artifact. The
    latched `restore_patch` is anchored on the SAME root for the same reason (a
    relative latch names a path in the tree it will be applied to)."""

    This lookup binds a reported or persisted spelling inside the current active

    read from a task and rebound for a current or fresh workspace. An absolute value
    passes through untouched. A relative value — including a bare basename — is probed
    against ``paths.project`` first and falls back under
    ``paths.implementation_artifacts``. When an operation must instead address the tree
    recorded by the task, use :func:`runs.task_spec_path`, which anchors a bare basename
    directly on that tree without this fallback. Recovery uses
    ``recovery_flow.RecoveryFlow._attempt_owned_spec`` to bind restoration to exactly
    one trusted regular-file candidate after probing both locations.

    Neither branch promises the result exists — the fallback is returned unprobed
    when the project candidate is not a file — so every caller re-tests
    ``.is_file()`` itself. Deliberately does NOT ``.resolve()``: callers needing
    symlink and ``..`` normalization get it from :func:`spec_within_roots`, which
    resolves both sides itself.

    The rule its call sites follow: a caller that goes on to REWRITE the spec must
    pair this with :func:`spec_within_roots` first. The value is session-reported
    and this function hands back whatever it spells, so the containment check is
    what stands between an untrusted string and a write to it. The frontmatter
    reconcile, the marker repair and the repair/review spec resets all pair it; so
    do the two attempt-binding observations, which write nothing themselves but
    establish the binding ``recovery_flow`` later restores bytes through — the
    check belongs at the site conferring the authority, not only at the write.

    The rule is about writes to the SPEC, not writes in general, and two callers sit
    outside it deliberately: the post-dev board sync and the sweep bundle's ledger
    close each read a ``status:`` from an unchecked path and then write to a
    deterministic orchestrator-owned target of their own (the sprint board, the
    deferred-work ledger). An out-of-tree spec can influence what those write, never

    proof-of-work and asked to be told anyway (``observe_skipped_proof``), it is

    when it held some, and ``None`` when nothing was observed — no skip, no

    does not say: the gate would have found changes it counts, measured under the
    gate's own exclusions. It does not say who wrote them — in a shared checkout
    the gate itself cannot attribute residue to a session, and this observation
    inherits exactly that limit. It is deliberately a return value and
    not a gate input: the observation must be made HERE because the baseline it
    measures from is derived here (the newer-claim branch can re-anchor
    ``proof_baseline`` and drop untracked evidence), and no caller can reproduce

    a commit that arrived in a shared ``isolation = "none"`` checkout from outside
    the session as this attempt's work — the exact false negative the observation
    exists to expose.

    shared verbatim by :func:`verify_dev`, :func:`verify_dev_bundle`, and

    gates can't silently drift. Reads frontmatter once; a caller that had to read

    :class:`_SharedGateResult` whose ``outcome`` is a failing
    :class:`VerifyOutcome`, or ``None`` when every gate passes and the caller may
    run its mode-specific tail.

    The proof-of-work exclude is derived here from the `task` this gate already
    receives (`verify_dev_exclude_relpaths`, which needs the latched restore patch);
    ``extra_exclude`` carries only what a mode adds on top — the engine-written
    paths for sprint and bundle, those plus the story record + manifest for
    stories, and ``None`` on the two legs that skip the gate outright (sprint's
    park, stories' plan halt). Threading the restore patch in
    from three call sites instead left a default-None foot-gun for a future fourth
    mode, which would silently let a restore re-drive pass proof-of-work on the
    patch file's mere presence. ``extra_exclude=None`` still skips the gate
    outright, and two callers now spell it for two different reasons: a plan-halt
    leg produced only its own spec (structurally spec-only), and a park may
    legitimately have produced no code at all because its remaining work is a
    human's (#676). Both mean "there is no diff to demand here"; neither
    generalizes to the other's leg, so keep them named separately.

    ``observe_skipped_proof`` is the same exclusion tuple the caller WOULD have
    passed as ``extra_exclude`` had it not skipped the gate. When set on a skipped
    leg the probe still runs — against the baseline derived above, not the raw
    ``task.baseline_commit`` — purely to answer whether there was in fact a diff,
    and the answer rides out on ``_SharedGateResult.skipped_proof_zero_diff``.
    Nothing branches on it here: a fault degrades to ``None`` rather than
    escalating, and the leg's outcome is identical either way. It exists so an
    accepted park's skipped gate stops being silent (#676) — a park the waived
    gate would have passed and one it would have refused are otherwise
    indistinguishable after the fact.

    Both skipping legs ask for it. Sprint mode's park and stories mode's plan halt
    have independent selectors — the park's session-authored assertion and the
    plan halt's strict ``result_json`` marker — while the observation records only
    what each waived gate would have found. It never replaces either selector and
    never changes acceptance.

    The two parameters are MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE by construction: ``extra_exclude``
    gates and ``observe_skipped_proof`` observes, and the arms below are ``if`` /
    ``elif`` on that order. Passing both is not a richer mode, it is a caller
    error that silently drops the observation — the gate arm wins and the leg was
    never skipped, so there was nothing to observe. Pass ``extra_exclude`` OR
    ``observe_skipped_proof``, never both.

    ``artifact_only_dir`` is the bundle leg's artifact-only RECEIPT (DW-273), and
    it composes onto the gate arm only: when the ordinary probe positively answers
    "nothing changed" (``is False`` — a refusal or a fault never reaches it) and
    the caller passed a directory, :func:`_artifact_dir_owned_entries` lists that
    directory's IGNORED entries (`!!` records only — tracked and untracked ones
    are what the ordinary probe already measured) and keeps those the ATTEMPT
    created or changed against ``task.baseline_artifacts``, the fingerprint
    snapshot ``Engine._dev_phase`` stamped at its start; a positive owned set is
    accepted as proof of work with its count on
    ``_SharedGateResult.artifact_only_residue``. No owned entry (an empty
    directory, or one holding only residue that predates the attempt), no
    snapshot on the task, a directory outside ``paths.repo_root`` (or equal to
    it) or a git refusal keep the ordinary retry, with the receipt's refusal
    appended to the verbatim reason; a ``GitError`` escalates through the same
    ``except`` as the ordinary probe's. Only :func:`verify_dev_bundle` passes it — ``verify_dev`` and
    ``verify_dev_stories`` never do, so a story result asserting
    ``artifact_only`` still owes the ordinary diff — and the caller passes it only
    when the session's synthesized result carries the strict ``artifact_only:
    True`` boolean, so the decision to consult the receipt is the caller's and
    this gate never reads ``rj`` for it. It lives HERE rather than after the fact
    for the reason ``skipped_proof_zero_diff`` does: the ordinary probe's baseline
    can be re-anchored by the newer-claim branch above, and "the gate found
    nothing" is known at exactly one point."""

        The gate arm and the observation arm differ in exactly one input — which
        mode-supplied tuple composes onto the gate's own exclusions — and in
        nothing else. They were briefly two spelled-out copies of the same five
        arguments, and every property the docstrings claim for the observation

        ``proof_baseline``, that it inherits ``include_untracked_proof``) was
        silently droppable in the copy while the gate stayed correct and the suite
        stayed green. A shared body makes the two unable to disagree by
        construction, which is stronger than any test over the copies: divergence
        is no longer a thing a reader can express here.

        to a different root is not merely wrong, it is SILENTLY wrong — git
        matches nothing and the exclusion evaporates.

        Tri-state on purpose: ``None`` means git REFUSED to answer — any rc outside

    """Verify a dev session's on-disk artifacts against its result.json claims.

    Checks the claimed spec exists, carries the fixed ``auto-dev`` workflow tag,
    sits at the expected status (``in-review`` when a separate review session
    follows, ``done`` when review is disabled), has produced changes (every leg
    but the park — see ``operator_park`` below), and that the story's
    sprint-status was advanced to the matching stage. Returns a retryable
    VerifyOutcome on any mismatch, escalates on git failure, passes otherwise.

    The spec's baseline frontmatter is an OPTIONAL attestation: a usable
    ``baseline_revision`` or legacy ``baseline_commit`` claim is checked against
    the accepted orchestrator baseline, while absence of both claims is accepted.
    Absence does not waive proof-of-work; without a claim, changes are still
    measured from the orchestrator-recorded ``task.baseline_commit``.

    ``operator_park`` (``[operator] enabled``, engine-supplied) adds one more
    accepted spec/sprint pair: ``(awaiting-operator, awaiting-operator)``, the
    park a dev session declares when the story's remaining work is a human's
    (#335). The OBSERVED spec status selects which pair is demanded — the skill
    decides whether it parked, and the gate then holds it to the matching board
    state and to a non-empty action list. Off by policy, the token is simply not
    a terminal the gate knows, so it fails the ordinary status check and the
    session is retried with that mismatch as feedback.

    The proof-of-work gate is skipped only when the observed park intersects a
    strict current-session result assertion — ``skip_proof = parked and
    rj.get("park_asserted") is True``. ``parked`` comes from the independently
    observed spec status plus policy. ``park_asserted`` is minted by
    :func:`devcontract.synthesize_result` only from the last genuine, non-fenced
    ``## Auto Run Result`` marker whose status is ``awaiting-operator``. Both
    halves are load-bearing. The skip exists
    because a park's whole output can legitimately be its own spec's park
    declaration plus the board sync, both of which proof-of-work already excludes,
    so demanding a diff read a correct park as "no changes since baseline commit"
    and refused it (#676) — costing the attempt, and with it the park declaration:
    reverted outright under ``isolation = "worktree"`` or
    ``scm.rollback_on_failure = true``, and a paused run with manual-recovery steps
    on the default in-place config. What is still pending here is the
    ORCHESTRATOR's commit — the squash plus the park record land only after this
    gate passes — not the session's own work: ``bmad-build-auto`` commits each
    iteration, so a skill commit chain usually already sits above baseline
    (``Engine._finalize_commit_phase``), and a reset discards that too, onto an
    ``attempt-preserve/*`` ref.

    The assertion establishes attempt ownership, not honesty or a second status
    authority. A frontmatter-only fallback, a legacy result, a malformed value,
    or a marker carrying the orchestrator's missing-marker repair note cannot
    authorize the waiver. Those parks are not otherwise refused: they take the
    ordinary proof-of-work arm, so one carrying a real diff still passes. Crash
    and fixable-retry replay preserve the already synthesized result rather than
    deriving authority from retained frontmatter or ``operator_actions``.

    Nothing else relaxes on the asserted leg either — the ``operator_actions``
    gate above still refuses a park that enumerates nothing, and the workflow-tag,
    status, baseline-match and sprint-pair gates all still run. Two of those four
    are not independent evidence on this leg, and saying so is the point: the
    status check is tautological here (the same ``fm`` that selected ``parked`` is
    threaded in as ``fm=fm``, so the shared gate compares it against an
    ``expected_status`` derived from itself), and the sprint pair was written from
    that same frontmatter by ``Engine._post_dev_state_sync`` a dozen lines before
    this gate runs, so it confirms the orchestrator's own write landed rather than
    anything the session did. What still binds a park to the attempt the
    orchestrator actually launched is the workflow tag, the baseline match, the
    non-empty actions list and the independent result-marker assertion.
    Baseline-match also
    accepts a claim NEWER than the recorded baseline whenever it is a
    HEAD-reachable descendant, and the comment guarding that branch names the
    compensating control: such a commit "may have arrived in the shared checkout
    from outside the session", so the check re-anchors proof-of-work onto the
    claimed commit rather than trusting the match alone. Proof-of-work is precisely
    what this leg skips, so on a park that re-anchoring still gates nothing — but
    it is no longer inert: the observation below inherits it, so a foreign commit
    cannot be credited as this attempt's work in the record either.

    The accepted skip is no longer silent, and it is recorded on TWO fields
    because one cannot carry both facts. ``VerifyOutcome.park_proof_skipped`` is
    the waiver itself — ``skip_proof``, ``False`` on every other leg. When it
    fires, the shared gate additionally runs the proof-of-work probe as a pure
    OBSERVATION (``observe_skipped_proof=engine_written``) and what that probe
    found rides out on ``VerifyOutcome.park_zero_diff``: ``True`` when the waived
    gate would have found nothing it counts, ``False`` when it would have found
    something, ``None`` when the probe could not answer. Read ``False`` as exactly
    that and no further — the residue the gate counts is not attributed to a
    session, here or in the gate itself, because under a shared checkout it cannot
    be (see the newer-claim paragraph above, and `docs/FEATURES.md` on
    ``isolation``). What separates "unknown" from "no skip happened" is
    ``park_proof_skipped``, not this field — collapsing the two into
    ``park_zero_diff is not None`` would make a park whose probe faulted look like
    a leg that never waived anything, and it would go unrecorded — the silence
    this record exists to end. ``None`` means "the probe could not answer", and
    reaches here three ways: a ``GitError`` (timeout, spawn or decode fault), a
    git REFUSAL such as an unresolvable baseline (any rc that is not one of git's
    two real answers, rc 128 being the everyday one — the gate arm folds that into
    its fail-open, the observation arm keeps it as unknown), and an attempt
    carrying no ``task.baseline_commit`` to measure from (the shared gate runs
    neither arm without one). Neither field changes an outcome: an unanswerable
    probe degrades rather than escalating, and an eligible park verifies
    identically either way. Their consumer is
    :meth:`Engine._verify_dev_artifacts`, which journals
    ``park-proof-of-work-skipped`` for a waived gate that this function then
    PASSED, and carries the observation as that record's ``zero_diff`` field, so a
    park the waived gate would have passed and one it would have refused stop
    being indistinguishable afterwards (#676). Both ends of that scope are set here: a
    waiver refused by a later check in this function (the sprint pair) never
    reaches the record, and a record that IS written asserts only that this gate
    was cleared with proof-of-work waived — the configured ``[verify]`` commands,
    the review loop and the commit all run afterwards and may still reject the
    attempt, which is then retried or deferred with its record already written.

    ``engine_written`` names paths the orchestrator itself wrote above this gate
    during the attempt, relative to ``paths.repo_root`` — the tree the gate invokes
    git in, and therefore the root every pathspec composed into this exclusion set
    must share (#716). They compose with the mode's normal proof-of-work exclusions
    so engine bookkeeping cannot masquerade as session work; see
    :meth:`Engine._harvest_gate_exclude`, which is their producer and states what a
    ledger outside the code tree resolves to. On the skipped park leg they are
    passed as ``observe_skipped_proof`` instead of ``extra_exclude``: no gate
    consumes them there, but the zero-diff observation must exclude exactly what
    the gate would have, or the orchestrator's own bookkeeping writes would be
    counted as residue on the park's record.

    """verify_dev for a deferred-work bundle: bundles have no sprint-status
    entry. The orchestrator owns the bundle→dw-id binding (``task.dw_ids``,

    primitive never authors dw ids. So the dw_ids cross-check is enforced only
    when the session actually claims them — an empty/absent claim is the normal
    generic path and passes.

    ``engine_written`` has the same contract as :func:`verify_dev`.

    The artifact-only RECEIPT (DW-273) is this leg's alone. A bundle whose only
    permitted deliverable lives under a gitignored ``implementation_artifacts``
    (a spec-only erratum) can never satisfy the ordinary proof-of-work probe —
    it measures tracked and untracked-not-ignored paths only — and a bundle has
    no ``awaiting-operator`` park to fall back on (``_operator_park_enabled`` is
    False for bundles). So when the session's synthesized result carries the
    strict ``artifact_only: True`` boolean — minted by ``devcontract`` from the
    current session's genuine marker, never from frontmatter, exactly as
    ``park_asserted`` is — and the ordinary probe positively found nothing, the
    gate accepts, in its place, the ignored entries of a ``git status --ignored``
    listing scoped to ``paths.implementation_artifacts`` that THIS attempt
    created or changed — measured against the fingerprint snapshot
    ``Engine._dev_phase`` stamped on ``task.baseline_artifacts`` at the attempt's
    start — and the acceptance rides out as ``artifact_only_accepted`` /
    ``artifact_only_residue`` (the owned count) for the sweep engine to journal. A bundle with a real change passes the ordinary arm and
    records no receipt; a loose truthy value (``"true"``, ``1``) is no assertion.

    What the receipt does NOT relax: the workflow tag, the expected status, the
    baseline match, the dw_ids cross-check below, the configured ``[verify]``
    commands, and the review gate — ``verify_review_bundle`` still requires every
    bundle id ``status: done``. And what the receipt's ownership check does not
    reach: ignored paths carry no git baseline, so "created or changed" is read
    off ``lstat`` fingerprints (mtime and size) rather than content — a rewrite
    that lands byte-identical with a preserved mtime is invisible to it, as it
    is to the ordinary probe. The assertion selects the receipt; the snapshot is

    Same gates as :func:`verify_dev` — workflow tag, expected frontmatter status,
    baseline match, proof-of-work since baseline — with two differences: the spec
    is resolved **deterministically by id** (``task.story_key``) via
    ``stories.resolve_story_spec`` rather than trusting the session-claimed path,
    and the sprint-status gate is dropped (stories mode has no sprint board).
    A resolution that is pending / ambiguous / a sentinel is a retryable failure,
    and the resolved filename's id prefix is asserted to equal the task id.

    ``plan_halt`` verifies a spec_checkpoint story's plan-halt leg instead of an
    implementation: the expected status is ``ready-for-dev`` (the plan is done,
    not the code) and the proof-of-work gate is skipped — a plan writes only its
    own spec, which proof-of-work already excludes, so requiring code changes
    would spuriously fail every plan leg. The spec-resolution, id-prefix, workflow,
    and baseline gates still run, and ``task.spec_file`` is still recorded. A
    ``plan_halt`` leg also requires the ``result_json`` to carry the ``plan_halt``
    marker ``devcontract`` emits on a clean plan-halt, so a died-mid-flight
    ``ready-for-dev`` can't be mistaken for a successful plan. A passing halt
    returns what the skipped proof gate would have found as
    ``VerifyOutcome.plan_halt_zero_diff``; that observation never affects the
    marker cross-check or the outcome.

    The two roots split by what is being addressed, and the split is deliberate:
    the artifacts these gates read — the claimed spec, ``paths.sprint_status``,
    ``paths.deferred_work`` — are BMAD output and stay project-rooted, while
    ``[verify] commands`` are the operator's build/test verbs and belong in the
    git root the code lives in. Every other caller of these commands already
    resolves them that way: the dev side runs them in ``Workspace.root``
    (``Engine._verify_commands_with_results``), which ``Workspace.default`` sets
    from ``paths.repo_root``, and ``cli._reverify`` is handed ``paths.repo_root``
    at both of its call sites. The three review gates were the sole outlier
    (#695).

    The two roots are the same path in the default layout and under worktree
    isolation (``ProjectPaths.rebased`` sets both); they diverge only under an
    explicit ``repo_root:`` with ``isolation = "none"``. One helper rather than
    three edited lines so the three gates cannot drift apart on the split.

    On win32 the cwd carries one more thing with it, so the split is not purely a
    subprocess concern: ``verify_commands_outcome`` forwards ``cwd`` a second time
    into ``env_fault_reason`` -> ``_win32_env_fault_reason``, which resolves a
    command's leading token as ``cwd / token`` to tell "tool missing" from "command
    failed" — and an env fault escalates where a plain failure retries. So a
    RELATIVE verify command is now classified against ``repo_root`` on these legs
    too. That is the correct direction (classification should follow execution, and
    the dev side already classifies against the same root), but it is a second
    consequence of the move rather than a restatement of the first.

    ``paths.repo_root`` is the ONLY member of ``paths`` this reads — it takes the
    whole dataclass to keep the three call sites uniform, not because it consults
    anything else. A future caller must not infer that artifact paths reach here.

    ``on_results`` is forwarded, not consumed: an engine-supplied sink is how
    review-gate results reach the journal, which the dev side has always had and
    these gates had not. Optional, so the gates stay callable from core (and from
    tests) with no engine at all — no sink simply means nothing is recorded,
    which is what every direct caller got before.

    This is also the ONLY sanctioned caller of ``verify_commands_outcome``; a
    fourth gate reaching past it would re-open #695. Enforced, not merely stated
    — see ``tests/test_portability_guard.py``.

    the sole ``sprint_advance`` caller, ``verify_dev`` asserted the write landed,
    and ``advance`` never regresses). A board now sitting *earlier* than ``done``
    is therefore not a stage the story never reached — it is a review session
    deliberately revoking the sign-off. Nothing in the review loop re-advances
    the board, so retrying only replays the same failure until the budget runs
    out and the work is rolled back; under
    ``review.on_status_contradiction = "escalate"`` (the default) the gate
    escalates instead, naming both sides. See #334.

    ``(awaiting-operator, awaiting-operator)`` is the second accepted pair, on
    the same observed-spec-status selection ``verify_dev`` uses: this is the gate
    the park path runs before committing (``Engine._park_awaiting_operator``), so
    parked work clears exactly the deterministic checks every other commit path
    clears *at this gate* — the pair, a non-empty action list, and the verify
    commands. The scope is load-bearing: a ``done`` story additionally clears
    proof-of-work at the dev gate, which a park no longer does (#676), so this
    gate is not evidence that a park faced every check a ``done`` story faced. The
    sign-off-regression arm stays scoped to the ``done`` pair: a board short of
    ``awaiting-operator`` is a stage never reached, not a revoked sign-off.

    ``operator_park`` is the SAME engine-supplied flag ``verify_dev`` takes, not a
    second reading of ``policy.operator.enabled``, so the two gates cannot
    disagree about whether this run parks. They would: the engine's
    ``_operator_park_enabled`` is an override seam, and a mode that opts out of
    parking while still reaching this gate would otherwise find it accepting a
    park the engine itself refuses to take.

    bmad-build-auto now commits its own work at the end of each iteration (one
    commit for the dev pass, one for each follow-up review pass), while the
    orchestrator still writes its own bookkeeping (sprint-status.yaml for
    stories, the deferred-work ledger for sweep bundles) into the working tree
    uncommitted. This squashes that whole chain — the skill's per-iteration
    commits PLUS the orchestrator's uncommitted writes — back onto `baseline`
    as a single commit carrying the orchestrator's message, so the one-commit-
    per-story invariant and the message template / pre_commit hook stay
    authoritative regardless of how many times the skill committed.

    Mechanics: stage the working tree (`add -A`), invoke the optional exact-index
    validator, move HEAD back to `baseline` keeping that same index (`reset
    --soft`), then commit the accumulated index without restaging. A post-commit
    HEAD probe and optional committed-tree validator detect an uncertain commit
    identity, hook mutation, or concurrent-index mutation and roll HEAD back to
    the original chain before refusing. The rollback leaves working-tree contents
    untouched, including changes made by hooks before the refusal.

    The no-op arm is validated the same way. "Nothing staged" is read off the
    index AFTER the staged validator returned, so an index reset to `baseline`
    inside that window (a concurrent writer — the same class the committed-tree
    validator exists for) reads as a clean no-op while the validated snapshot
    says a deliverable was staged. Returning `None` there would leave HEAD at
    `baseline` with the accepted chain orphaned and let the caller record
    `baseline` as the commit — a bundle closing without the pending-tracked
    deliverable it was accepted on (#795 review). So when a committed-tree
    validator is given, the no-op arm runs it against `baseline` itself: the
    snapshot must already be IN the baseline tree for "nothing to commit" to be
    true, and a disagreement restores the original chain and index (`reset
    --mixed`) before the refusal propagates.

    Residual-artifacts note (BMAD-METHOD #2563): the skill now commits every file
    of the reviewed diff and deliberately leaves unrelated `git status` residue
    uncommitted (files outside the change's scope). The `add -A` here sweeps that
    residue into the story commit too — an intentional divergence from the skill's
    scoped commit. The loop must end each story on a clean tree because story
    N+1's step-01 HALTs on a dirty tree, so the orchestrator squashes EVERYTHING
    since baseline (skill commits + its own bookkeeping + any residue) into the one
    story commit rather than leaving the tree dirty for the next story to trip on.

    Returns the new HEAD sha, or None when there is nothing to finalize: no
    version control (`baseline` falsy or NO_VCS) or the tree already equals

    """Why `target` must not be published, or `None` when it may be. Returns
    `(refuse_cause, error)` — the two fields a refusal carries beyond the
    caller's own identifying ones.

    TWO publishers share it, which is why it is a module-level seam rather than
    sweep machinery: `sweep._commit_ledger`'s nine call sites (the seven ledger
    publishers and the two pre-answer prunes), and `decisions.apply_pre_answer`'s
    out-of-band commit (DW-209/213). It lives HERE, beside `commit_paths`, because
    the hazard it guards is a property of that function — the missing-but-TRACKED
    path `commit_paths` deliberately keeps as a DELETION to stage — so the guard
    and the contract it gates read as one thing. `deferredwork` is already
    imported above and sits below this module, so the layering
    (`deferredwork` < `verify` < `sweep` < `decisions`) is unchanged and no cycle
    is created.

    The FAMILY is declared by the caller, never derived here. A `path ==
    paths.deferred_work` test would be exactly the "chosen by role" test
    `_commit_ledger`'s own naming rule refuses, and it would answer wrongly for a
    publisher whose ledger is symlinked (the argument is the RESOLVED target) or
    for any file a later caller publishes.

    LEDGER: `deferredwork.read_for_write`, because the ledger's own read
    contract (DW-146/DW-279) answers `None` for absence, `LedgerReadFault`
    for OS metadata/text-read faults, and its parent `LedgerReadError` for
    bytes nobody can decode. Here read faults do not propagate, because
    every caller is best-effort bookkeeping whose whole degrade discipline
    exists so a publication fault never aborts the work that wrote the file. The
    two faults are NOT folded into one cause, though (DW-237): the
    `LedgerReadFault` subclass is handled first as `target-unreadable`, as is
    a raw probe `OSError`; the remaining `LedgerReadError` returns
    `target-undecodable`, because they differ in the one way a
    caller holding a retry obligation has to know about. Undecodable bytes are a
    DURABLE content shape — a replay re-reads the same file and refuses it
    identically, exactly like an absence or a directory — while an `OSError` a
    probe RAISED (an EACCES parent, a WinError 64 from a
    registered-but-not-serving UNC provider) is a TRANSIENT host answer the next
    pass may well not see. So the four causes split three DURABLE
    (`target-absent`, `target-not-a-file`, `target-undecodable`) against one
    TRANSIENT (`target-unreadable`), and the split is drawn HERE, in the
    classifier, rather than at a call site re-reading the ledger or matching the
    fault text. The caller that needs it is `Engine._carry_harvested_deferrals`,
    the one publisher carrying a durable `harvest_carry_commit_pending` latch
    (DW-195/#552): it refuses every durable cause outright and hands only the
    transient one back to `commit_paths`, where a `GitError` keeps the latch for
    the replay. Before the split, both faults arrived as `target-unreadable`
    and that fall-through published the undecodable bytes — git accepts any
    bytes — so the corrupt ledger reached HEAD. The store leg never produces
    `target-undecodable`: it asks nothing about bytes. No lock is taken: this is
    a read the writer above already took. A later disappearance or replacement
    can still change what git publishes, as `_commit_ledger` documents.

    A ledger read of `None` means absence or a non-regular file. Re-probe with
    `stat` to distinguish `target-absent` from `target-not-a-file`; unlike
    `exists`, it exposes OS refusals on every supported interpreter. Metadata
    may change between probes, so this second probe must independently fold
    non-absence errors into `target-unreadable`.

    STORE: a regular file must be there, except for the resolved symlink-loop
    entry described below. Nothing is asked about its bytes.
    The writer emits valid UTF-8 JSON, but this guard does not check whether
    those bytes were replaced after the write, so a present, non-UTF-8 regular
    file stays publishable. `_prune_pre_answers`' own DW-176 absence refusal is
    about the LEDGER it reads, not the store.

    The TYPE test is the DW-211/228 half, and it is not decoration: existence
    alone let a store replaced by a DIRECTORY (or by a symlink to one) through
    the guard, and `commit_paths` hands the literal pathspec to `git add`, which
    stages a directory's descendants RECURSIVELY — an unrelated tree published
    under a `chore(sweep):`/`chore(decisions):` message. The test is ONE guarded
    `lstat()` on the argument (DW-257): `S_ISREG` publishes a regular file,
    `S_ISLNK` publishes a link entry (see the resolved-argument paragraph for
    which link that is), and any other present type (directory, FIFO, device,
    socket) is refused `target-not-a-file`, which is neither absent nor
    unreadable and names a different operator repair than either. A store
    symlinked to a regular file still publishes: the callers hand over the
    RESOLVED path, so this guard sees the regular target, and a caller that
    hands over the link itself lands on the `S_ISLNK` arm.

    The probe can also FAIL rather than answer, and `lstat` is the probe that
    REPORTS that on every supported interpreter. Until DW-257 this leg asked
    `is_file()`/`is_symlink()`/`exists()`: on Python 3.11–3.13 those absorb only
    the `ENOENT`/`ENOTDIR`/`ELOOP` class of errnos and RAISE the rest, so an
    `EACCES` arriving after a successful write used to escape a best-effort
    publisher (DW-227) — aborting `bmad-loop decisions`' walk or undercounting a
    TUI answer — and DW-227 folded that raise into `target-unreadable`, for the
    same reason the ledger leg folds its own `OSError`. But Python 3.14
    suppresses ALL OS errors inside those three probes, so there the same
    `EACCES` never reached the `except` at all: every probe answered False and
    the store degraded to `target-absent` — a present file reported as gone,
    where this guard's own ledger leg said `target-unreadable`. `lstat`
    suppresses nothing, so what its fault MEANS is decided by
    `deferredwork.probe_absence`, the one classification the ledger's
    repair/write reader and this guard's ledger leg also ask (DW-256/DW-268):
    `FileNotFoundError`/`NotADirectoryError`, pathlib's ignored winerrors
    (`deferredwork.ABSENCE_WINERRORS` — 21/123/1921, a disconnected mapped
    drive or a lexically invalid Windows path) and the `ValueError` a
    non-encodable path raises are the absence the old probes answered False
    for, and every other `OSError` — the refusal included — folds into
    `target-unreadable` on 3.11 through 3.14 alike. The `ValueError` half
    matters because this GUARD's callers hold only an `except OSError` around
    it: absorbed here, it cannot escape the guard. (The publishers' own
    `resolve()` arms, which run first, are unchanged and still raise the same
    `ValueError` for a NUL on POSIX, where `realpath` does not tolerate it —
    pre-existing and outside DW-268.) The fold is
    DW-227's; the probe that lets it fire everywhere is DW-257's; the absorbed
    set is the one `is_file()` had before DW-221 and is owned by the helper.

    The probe is taken on the RESOLVED argument, which is what decides what the
    `S_ISLNK` arm actually buys — the same entry the old `is_symlink()`
    disjunct bought, and not what the spelling suggests. A DANGLING link does
    not survive the resolve as a link: non-strict `Path.resolve` collapses it to
    the plain non-existent path it points at, so `lstat` raises `ENOENT` and the
    store is refused `target-absent`. That is the right answer for it (the
    prune's writer, `atomic_write_text_confined`, REFUSES to write through a
    link at the store's own name, so a dangling one holds no write of ours to
    publish), but it means the arm is doing a different job: on Python 3.13+, a
    symlink LOOP resolves to the link ITSELF, which `lstat` — declining to
    follow the last component — reports as a link where `stat` would raise
    `ELOOP`. The `S_ISLNK` arm preserves publication of that link entry. Python
    3.11–3.12 instead raise during resolve, which each caller handles on its
    own — `_commit_ledger` takes its existing `sweep-ledger-commit-unavailable`
    arm before this helper runs, and `apply_pre_answer` folds the fault into a
    `target-unreadable` refusal.

    Returns the `refuse_cause` token as a `Literal` rather than a bare `str`,
    which is what makes the closed four-value claim
    `tests/test_portability_guard.py` declares `refuse_cause` benign on a
    typechecked property rather than a comment. The union is spelled identically
    in `decisions.PublishRefusal.cause`; pyright rejects producer tokens the
    receiving union does not accept, but does not enforce equality of the unions."""

    plus the `ERROR_NOT_READY`/`ERROR_INVALID_NAME`/`ERROR_CANT_RESOLVE_FILENAME`
    winerrors) and RAISE the rest, so an `EACCES` under one operand escaped as a
    bare `OSError` into best-effort publishers that have no handler for it
    (DW-227); Python 3.14 suppresses ALL OS errors inside them, so there the same
    fault never arrived at all — both probes answered False and a TRACKED candidate
    under an unsearchable parent was ruled MISSING, taking the missing-but-tracked
    arm below and offering its DELETION to `git add`. `lstat` suppresses nothing on
    any interpreter: `EACCES`, an `ELOOP` on an intermediate component and
    `ENAMETOOLONG` all REPORT into the uncertainty slot instead of answering False,
    so that slot is now reachable everywhere. So does every errno the pair absorbed
    but `ENOENT`/`ENOTDIR` — `EBADF` and those three winerrors included — and that
    is a deliberate widening rather than a side effect: an operand a Windows host
    calls not-ready or unspellable is a path this cannot say anything about, and
    saying so is the whole of DW-239. The cost is disclosed: as a SOLE operand such
    a path used to be a clean no-op and now raises `GitError`, which the best-effort
    publishers above already handle and which is the honest answer.

    It otherwise answers the same PRESENCE question the pair answered — success for
    every directory entry that exists, and `ENOENT`/`ENOTDIR` for the absence the
    pair reported as False. That equivalence includes the one entry the
    `is_symlink()` disjunct was actually there to buy, and it is not the dangling
    link the spelling suggests: every operand here is `resolve()`d first, and
    non-strict resolve collapses a dangling link to the plain non-existent path it
    points at, so `lstat` raises `FileNotFoundError` for it exactly as both probes
    answered False. What survives the resolve AS a link is a symlink LOOP, which
    Python 3.13+ resolves to the link itself — `exists()` False, `is_symlink()`
    True — and `lstat` succeeds on it because it does not follow the last component.
    `unpublishable_target`'s RESOLVED-argument paragraph makes the same distinction
    for the same reason. The guard still handles what a probe raises, not what it
    suppresses; there is simply nothing left here that suppresses."""

    `accepted_text`, so the blob it commits is the one `git add` of the validated

    terminal direct branch.  Once that transaction commits, target-only
    real-index reconciliation is replayable housekeeping: no later fault rolls the
    truthful commit back.

    `baseline_commit` is the HEAD beside which `baseline_text` was read. The
    blob that commit holds at the target is the baseline's identity — the text
    is a universal-newline reading, so its own encoding cannot name a CRLF blob
    Git preserved — and a text that no longer decodes to that blob is refused.
    The commit is also what tells an absent captured target apart: one it
    tracked has since been deleted by a rival commit, and the publication
    refuses rather than re-adding it. Without it an absent target has no
