# ``start_session`` (a caller-supplied task_id may be reused, and a silent session
# must not inherit a stale predecessor's outputs) and
# ``resolve._gather_escalations`` reads them back. Spelled here rather than three
# times, because a fourth artifact added to the reader alone would silently miss
# both adapters — which is the shape the parity was in before.
#
# ``result.json`` is the dev/review contract's own result file. ``escalation.json``
# is the SWEEP SKILL's: its automation contract
# (``data/skills/bmad-loop-sweep/automation-mode.md``) tells a sweep session to
# write that file and then mirror the same entries into ``result.json``'s
# ``escalations``. That sentence lived in both adapters' comments and nowhere else,
# and it is the whole reason the reader opens two names rather than one.
#
# ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING — but NOT because of the mirroring, which is the obvious
# reading and the wrong one: ``_gather_escalations`` keys its map on canonical
# JSON, so a mirrored entry's STORED value is byte-identical whichever copy is read
# first. What the order fixes is the POSITION of DISTINCT entries in the
# newest-first list the operator is shown — result.json's entries precede
# escalation.json's, and a repeat keeps its first occurrence's slot. Swap these two
# and ``tests/test_resolve.py``'s
# ``test_gather_escalations_preserves_result_before_escalation_file_order`` and
# ``test_gather_escalations_keeps_a_duplicates_first_position`` redden (measured,
# not reasoned about).
#
# Appending a name is bounded twice, so it is not free. ``_gather_escalations``
# JSON-parses every name here and skips anything that is not an
# ``{"escalations": [...]}`` document, so a name that does not carry that shape
# buys the reader nothing. And both adapters run this unlink loop AFTER
# ``start_session`` has already written ``prompt.txt`` into the same directory, so
# a name an earlier step of that method writes would be deleted on the way out.
#
# Four other cycle-scoped files live in ``tasks/<task_id>/`` and are deliberately
# NOT here, because each is owned and read by ONE adapter rather than shared:
# ``heartbeat.json``, ``resultless-stops.jsonl`` and ``session-lifecycle.jsonl``
# (``adapters/generic.py``) and ``messages.json`` (``adapters/opencode_http.py``).

# site spells either one, which makes them invisible to anything reading call sites
# and easy for a consumer to mistake for a producer-supplied field.
#
# Spelled here, at the minting site, because two consumers need exactly this set and
# a third copy is how they drift: ``diagnostics._scrub_entry`` must exempt them from
# the fail-closed arm it applies to a declared-schema kind (they are engine-minted,
# never LLM-authored, so collapsing ``log_pos`` to a presence marker would throw away
# a byte offset for no safety gain), and ``tests/test_portability_guard.py`` needs

# (``Journal.entries`` and ``tui.data.JournalTail.read_new``) need exactly one shape,
# and a second copy is how they drift. ``tui.widgets.journal_line`` imports the constant
# too and matches it by EQUALITY, so the styling rule cannot outlive a rename and cannot
# leak red onto a producer kind that merely contains this spelling.
#
# NOT a ``tests/test_portability_guard.py`` ``JOURNAL_KINDS`` row, deliberately: that

        The fault this closes (DW-97) costs TWO records, not one. This is the only
        writer in this module without a durable path — ``save_state`` uses
        ``atomic_replace``, ``write_verify_stream`` uses ``atomic_write_text`` — so a
        partially flushed write leaves a fragment with no trailing newline. Without
        the heal the NEXT append concatenates its own record onto that fragment, and
        both readers then drop the combined line: one fault, two lost records, and one
        of them may be an ``unit-merged`` that
        ``engine._replay_unlatched_ledger_carries`` needs to avoid re-driving merged
        work. Prepending the newline keeps the damage to the one record that was
        actually torn.

        Not routed through ``atomic_write_text``/``atomic_replace``: those rewrite the
        whole target, and this journal is append-only and grows for a whole run, so an
        "atomic append" would re-copy the entire file per record. The heal is the
        in-repo precedent at ``install.py``'s exclude-file writer
        (``existing if not existing or existing.endswith(b"\\n") else existing + b"\\n"``)
        applied at O(1) cost.

        Text mode stays, deliberately. Windows translates the ``"\\n"`` to ``"\\r\\n"``
        on the way out, which both readers already tolerate (``splitlines`` +
        ``strip``) and which leaves the file's LAST byte a newline either way, so the
        probe above stays correct without a mode change no other line here needs.

        The read-then-append window is racy, and the heal BOUNDS the loss rather than
        eliminating it — do not read it as a guarantee. POSIX ``O_APPEND`` (and
        Windows' append mode) places every write at the current end, so a rival
        appender cannot interleave INTO this record; but it can tear its own write
        inside the window, after the probe has already answered "terminated". That
        leaves a fresh fragment this append then concatenates onto, and the two-record
        loss recurs for that one pair. A rival that completes its line in the window
        is harmless: the tail stays terminated and the prepended newline, if any, is a
        blank line both readers skip. Closing the race needs a lock, which is
        deliberately out of scope here (as is fsync): this defect is the SEQUENTIAL
        concatenation — one writer's own torn record absorbing its own next one —
        which the probe closes completely.

        counts, never unbounded subprocess output inline.

        Its own directory, not ``logs/``: every other inhabitant of ``logs/`` is a
        coding-CLI pane capture named after a session task id.  The adapters own
        that namespace (they write ``{task_id}.log``) and the TUI reads the whole
        directory as one — with no session open, ``tui.data.active_task_id`` falls
        back to the newest ``logs/*.log`` and returns its stem as the live task,
        which the dashboard then reopens as ``logs/{stem}.log``.  Verifier streams
        land in exactly that window: session-end is journalled when the session
        ends, before its result reaches verification, so at the moment these files
        are newest no session is open and the fallback fires.  Under ``logs/`` that
        rendered verifier stderr in the agent log pane.  Keeping the store in a
        separate directory makes that unrepresentable, rather than a name filter
        every future reader of ``logs/`` would have to remember to apply.

        ``name`` is engine-generated (not plugin or command supplied), so it is
        safe to join below.  ``content`` arrives already bounded — the cap is
        ``verify.stream_capture_kb``, applied by the caller, which is also where
        the full-size and truncation bookkeeping lives; this method is journal
        storage only and never decides how much to keep.  Callers retain the
        original stream separately in a hook context.

        :func:`atomic_write_text`, never ``write_text`` (#379) — the rule
        ``install.py`` states flatly.  The fixed ``.tmp`` sibling this replaces is
        the collision that helper's own docstring exists to prevent, and its
        fsync-before-replace is what keeps a pointer from ever naming blocks that
        were never written.  ``follow_symlinks=False`` because these are
        machine-minted records under a run directory a coding-CLI session can
        reach: honouring a planted link would aim the write at a path of that
        session's choosing, and there is no operator-curated target here to
        preserve (contrast the ledgers the default was built for).

        Text mode is deliberate, and it is why the record's byte counts are
        defined over the *stream*, not the file: ``\\n`` is translated on Windows,
        so the file can be larger there than the count.  ``read_text`` normalizes
        it back, so the content round-trips either way.

        The write is **anchored at a directory descriptor** where the platform has
        one, because ``follow_symlinks=False`` covers the final component and
        nothing above it.  Sessions are handed this run directory outright
        (``BMAD_LOOP_RUN_DIR``, which is where they write ``result.json``), so a
        session that plants a symlink at ``verify/`` before verification redirects
        every record: ``mkdir(exist_ok=True)`` ACCEPTS a symlink-to-directory —
        it re-raises only when ``is_dir()`` is false, and that follows links — and
        the replace then lands wherever the link points, outside the run dir
        entirely.  Measured, not theorised.

        ``open_dir_confined`` is the fix the repo already keeps for exactly this
        (``tui/launch.py`` writes its control-window record the same way): it walks
        each component below the run dir ``O_NOFOLLOW`` and hands back a descriptor
        for the directory it actually reached, and :func:`atomic_write_text_at`
        never names a path again.  A path check would be answered *about a path*
        and stale the moment it returned — the session can re-plant the link
        between check and write — so this closes the window rather than narrowing
        it.  The ``mkdir`` above may still be fooled; that is harmless, because the
        confinement walk that follows is not, and refusal is what the fooled case
        produces.

        win32 has no ``*at()`` family to anchor against, so it keeps a
        check-then-write, and the check is :func:`is_link_like` rather than
        ``is_symlink()`` — on Windows the redirect that matters is a DIRECTORY
        JUNCTION, which ``is_symlink()`` reports False for and which ``mklink /J``
        creates with no elevation at all, while a directory symlink needs
        SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege or Developer Mode.  Checking only for
        symlinks there would leave the unprivileged half of the same escape open,
        and with no race to win.  The residual is the platform's: a path check is
        stale the moment it returns, but the planting session runs as the same uid
        as this writer and the names here are engine-minted, so the exposure is a
        redirected diagnostic rather than a foothold.

        Raises ``OSError`` — including when confinement cannot be established, so
        an unconfined ``verify/`` REFUSES rather than writing through the link.
        The caller degrades (this is observation), it does not swallow it here:
        the record still lands, with a null pointer and ``capture_error``.
