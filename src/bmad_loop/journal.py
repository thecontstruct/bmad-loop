        """Atomically retain one verifier subprocess stream under ``verify/`` and
        return its run-relative pointer.  The journal records the pointer and byte
        counts, never unbounded subprocess output inline.

        Its own directory, not ``logs/``: every other inhabitant of ``logs/`` is a
        coding-CLI pane capture named after a session task id.  The adapters own
        that namespace (they write ``{task_id}.log``) and the TUI reads the whole
        directory as one — with no session open, ``tui.data.active_task_id`` falls
        back to the newest ``logs/*.log`` and returns its stem as the live task,
        which the dashboard then reopens as ``logs/{stem}.log``.  Verifier streams
        land in exactly that window: session-end is journalled when the session
        ends, before its result reaches verification, so at the moment these files
        are newest no session is open and the fallback fires.  Under ``logs/`` that
        rendered verifier stderr in the agent log pane.  Keeping the store in a
        separate directory makes that unrepresentable, rather than a name filter
        every future reader of ``logs/`` would have to remember to apply.

        ``name`` is engine-generated (not plugin or command supplied), so it is
        safe to join below.  ``content`` arrives already bounded — the cap is
        ``verify.stream_capture_kb``, applied by the caller, which is also where
        the full-size and truncation bookkeeping lives; this method is journal
        storage only and never decides how much to keep.  Callers retain the
        original stream separately in a hook context.

        :func:`atomic_write_text`, never ``write_text`` (#379) — the rule
        ``install.py`` states flatly.  The fixed ``.tmp`` sibling this replaces is
        the collision that helper's own docstring exists to prevent, and its
        fsync-before-replace is what keeps a pointer from ever naming blocks that
        were never written.  ``follow_symlinks=False`` because these are
        machine-minted records under a run directory a coding-CLI session can
        reach: honouring a planted link would aim the write at a path of that
        session's choosing, and there is no operator-curated target here to
        preserve (contrast the ledgers the default was built for).

        Text mode is deliberate, and it is why the record's byte counts are
        defined over the *stream*, not the file: ``\\n`` is translated on Windows,
        so the file can be larger there than the count.  ``read_text`` normalizes
        it back, so the content round-trips either way.

        The write is **anchored at a directory descriptor** where the platform has
        one, because ``follow_symlinks=False`` covers the final component and
        nothing above it.  Sessions are handed this run directory outright
        (``BMAD_LOOP_RUN_DIR``, which is where they write ``result.json``), so a
        session that plants a symlink at ``verify/`` before verification redirects
        every record: ``mkdir(exist_ok=True)`` ACCEPTS a symlink-to-directory —
        it re-raises only when ``is_dir()`` is false, and that follows links — and
        the replace then lands wherever the link points, outside the run dir
        entirely.  Measured, not theorised.

        ``open_dir_confined`` is the fix the repo already keeps for exactly this
        (``tui/launch.py`` writes its control-window record the same way): it walks
        each component below the run dir ``O_NOFOLLOW`` and hands back a descriptor
        for the directory it actually reached, and :func:`atomic_write_text_at`
        never names a path again.  A path check would be answered *about a path*
        and stale the moment it returned — the session can re-plant the link
        between check and write — so this closes the window rather than narrowing
        it.  The ``mkdir`` above may still be fooled; that is harmless, because the
        confinement walk that follows is not, and refusal is what the fooled case
        produces.

        win32 has no ``*at()`` family to anchor against, so it keeps a
        check-then-write, and the check is :func:`is_link_like` rather than
        ``is_symlink()`` — on Windows the redirect that matters is a DIRECTORY
        JUNCTION, which ``is_symlink()`` reports False for and which ``mklink /J``
        creates with no elevation at all, while a directory symlink needs
        SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege or Developer Mode.  Checking only for
        symlinks there would leave the unprivileged half of the same escape open,
        and with no race to win.  The residual is the platform's: a path check is
        stale the moment it returns, but the planting session runs as the same uid
        as this writer and the names here are engine-minted, so the exposure is a
        redirected diagnostic rather than a foothold.

        Raises ``OSError`` — including when confinement cannot be established, so
        an unconfined ``verify/`` REFUSES rather than writing through the link.
        The caller degrades (this is observation), it does not swallow it here:
        the record still lands, with a null pointer and ``capture_error``.
