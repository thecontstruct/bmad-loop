"""Where code+git work happens, decoupled from where run state lives.

A Workspace pairs the directory sessions run in (and git operates on) with the
artifact paths rebased onto it. Run state (run_dir, journal, state.json) always
lives in the main repo and is passed separately — it never moves.

- isolation = none → Workspace.default(paths): root = paths.repo_root, behavior
  identical to operating directly on the project.
- isolation = worktree → per unit: a git worktree mounted under the run dir
  (.bmad-loop/runs/<run_id>/worktrees/, which `bmad-loop init` gitignores, so it
  stays invisible to the main checkout's `git status`), with paths rebased onto
  it. open_unit_workspace / close_unit_workspace manage the branch + worktree
  lifecycle; the engine merges the unit branch back into the target branch from
  the main repo between units.

    orphaned mount at ``wt`` — the deferred-work ledger, the sprint board and the
    accepted spec — for :func:`verify.snapshot_worktree`'s ``force_include``.

    Without this the orphan snapshot cannot see them at all. Its untracked
    candidates come from ``verify.untracked_files``, i.e. ``git ls-files --others
    --exclude-standard``, which excludes IGNORED files by contract — and these three
    are ignored inside every mount by construction: ``WorktreeFlow`` seeds them into
    a checkout that carries tracked files only, and folds every seeded rel into the
    worktree-local ``info/exclude`` so the unit's ``git add -A`` cannot ride them
    onto the merge. So the mount holds the only copy, the reclaim's
    ``worktree_remove(force=True)`` deletes it, and an orphan never merges — no
    carry runs and no replay handle survives (`_replay_unlatched_ledger_carries`
    gates on ``task.worktree_path``, cleared when the flip releases the mount).
    Worse, over a CLEAN tracked tree ``snapshot_worktree`` returns ``None``, so the
    loss came with no ref, no ``on_orphan_preserved`` callback and no journal line.

    Deliberately NARROW: naming every ignored path instead would park the seeded
    ``_bmad/`` tree, the adapters' MCP configs and venv residue into a
    ``refs/attempt-preserve-dirty/*`` object that ``scm.preserve_keep`` retains 20
    deep. Refusing the reclaim instead is no remedy either — every mount has
    shielded ignored files by construction, so the flip-back path would never work
    again.

    Derived from ``paths`` rebased onto the mount, and each candidate is included
    only when it is present there as a REGULAR FILE inside the mount root: the
    ``git add -f`` in ``snapshot_worktree`` is a repair write that raises (and so
    refuses the remount) on a path it cannot stage. ``resolve()`` decides
    containment, so a candidate that lands outside the mount drops out.

    Each candidate is judged ALONE, which is the whole point of the per-candidate
    ``try``. An artifacts dir configured outside the project tree is a supported
    shape, and ``ProjectPaths.rebased`` deliberately leaves it unmoved there
    ("configured outside the project tree; doesn't move"): the ledger and the board
    then resolve outside the mount and SHOULD drop, because they are shared rather
    than per-checkout and the reclaim cannot destroy them. The spec must not drop
    with them — ``WorktreeFlow._accepted_spec_seed`` lays it INSIDE the mount
    whatever the artifacts dir is doing, so there it is still the only copy. A
    single ``try`` around the loop returned ``()`` for all three the moment the
    first candidate raised, making this fix silently inert in exactly that
    configuration — the same silence it exists to remove.

    Naming DEGRADES to ``()`` only on a setup fault (the mount path or the rebase
    itself), in ``WorktreeFlow._ledger_seed``'s style: this function decides which
    rels are orchestrator-owned, and an unanswerable question about that is not
    evidence of work to lose. The #340 gate stays where the capture is — a rel this
    DOES name that git then cannot stage raises and leaves the orphan standing.

    Three-way guard before any git runs *in* ``wt``: the path exists, it is one of
    ``repo_root``'s registered linked worktrees, AND git invoked there reports that
    exact toplevel (:func:`verify.worktree_is_registered`). The run dir lives INSIDE
    the project checkout, so a leftover plain directory (rmtree fallback residue, an
    operator's copy) would otherwise make ``git status``/``add`` address the
    PROJECT's own working tree and park — or worse, report as the orphan's — the
    user's uncommitted edits. Anything that fails the guard is left to the reclaim
    exactly as before this gate existed.

    ``baseline_untracked=[]``, not ``None``: a mount is a fresh checkout, so every
    non-ignored untracked file in it was run-created (seeded skill/config files are
    shielded as ignored, see ``provision_worktree``) and there is no pre-existing
    user file to protect — ``None`` would park the tracked edits and silently drop
    every untracked file, which for a run that writes new modules is most of the
    work. The snapshot is taken against the orphan's OWN ``HEAD`` (before any story
    branch reset below moves that ref) so the parked commit is parented at the tree
    the orphan actually diverged from and holds only what was uncommitted.

    ``[]`` is nonetheless the MAXIMALLY preserving value and still not enough: the
    parked set is the derived difference ``untracked_files(repo) -
    baseline_untracked``, and ``untracked_files`` excludes ignored paths by
    contract. The orchestrator's own artifacts are ignored inside every mount by
    construction, so they need the narrow ``force_include``
    :func:`_orphan_owned_rels` derives — which is also what makes a CLEAN tracked
    tree stop being a silent total loss, since the forced ``add`` is what lifts the
    snapshot tree above HEAD.

    An orphan holding nothing in either set is a no-op (no ref, no callback). A
    capture failure raises :class:`verify.GitError` and so refuses the remount
    (#340: a capture failure over a tree with something to lose is a gate, not a
    footnote) — the orphan is left standing for manual recovery, and the caller's
    ``worktree-open-failed`` path defers the unit. ``OSError`` from the snapshot's
    temp index is folded into that same refusal rather than escaping untyped.

    The worktree is mounted under the run dir (see unit_worktrees_dir), not under

    story-scoped branches are abandoned-attempt state: commits unique to their
    named tip are parked under ``attempt-preserve/*``, then the story branch is
    compare-and-swap reset to the pinned base before remount.

    Existing run-scoped branches are cumulative and reattach carrying every unit
    landed so far — but at a tip *caught up to the pinned base*, not blindly at
    their own tip. The target can advance while the run branch is unmounted (live
    policy flips isolation off, a story lands in place on the target, policy flips
    back), and a remount at the stale tip would develop the next unit without that
    story: ``merge_strategy = "ff"`` then refuses integration, the other strategies
    merge stale work. Three shapes, decided on pinned shas: the run tip already
    contains the base — mount as-is; the run tip is an ancestor of the base — the
    run branch is compare-and-swap fast-forwarded to the base BEFORE the mount, so
    the mount comes up at the base; the two diverged — mount at the tip and merge
    the base into the run branch inside the fresh mount. Divergence is the NORMAL
    serial-unit shape under ``merge_strategy = "squash"`` (the target receives a
    squash commit that does not contain the run tip), and identical content on both
    sides merges clean. A conflicting merge is aborted, the just-created mount is
    dropped, and :class:`verify.GitError` is raised: the run branch tip is unchanged
    and an operator must reconcile. The returned ``baseline`` is read AFTER that
    catch-up, so the attempt baseline is the tree the session actually starts from.

    Whatever already occupies the deterministic mount path is reclaimed first. If
    it is a registered worktree of ``repo_root`` (an orphan left standing by an
    isolation flip, see the reclaim comment) its *uncommitted* state — tracked edits,
    run-created untracked files, and the orchestrator-owned artifacts the mount
    shields as ignored (ledger, board, and the ``spec_file`` binding when one is
    passed; see :func:`_orphan_owned_rels`) — is parked under
    ``refs/attempt-preserve-dirty/<run>-<head>-orphan`` before the force-remove; an
    orphan holding none of them parks nothing. ``on_orphan_preserved`` (worktree
    path, ref) fires once per parked snapshot so a caller with a journal can record it —
    ``open_unit_workspace`` has none, in the style of ``close_unit_workspace``'s
    ``on_teardown_degraded``. A snapshot that cannot be written refuses the remount
    (raises ``GitError``) and leaves the orphan standing.

    Both ref moves — the story reset and the run fast-forward — are refused up front
    when the branch is checked out anywhere other than that mount path (an operator
    moved a retained recovery worktree, or holds the branch in the main checkout):

    On failure the unit's full diff against its baseline is written to
    `run_dir/failed/<unit_key>/changes.patch` for forensics; when keep_failed is
    set the worktree + branch are left mounted for inspection and nothing else
    happens. On success (or failure without keep_failed) the worktree is removed
    and, if delete_branch, the branch deleted. Returns the patch path it wrote,
    or None.

    Invariant: the teardown tail is post-merge/post-capture housekeeping — the
    unit's content is already safe (merged on success, patch-captured on failure)
    before it runs, so no git teardown failure escapes it. Every `GitError` from
    the worktree removal or branch deletion degrades to a call of
    on_teardown_degraded (given the failure message) instead of crashing the run;
    a clean or force-retried removal is silent (see the teardown tail below). A
    failed diff *capture* breaks the tail's premise instead — the worktree would
    then hold the only copy of the unit's changes — so it is reported the same
    way but preserves the worktree + branch rather than tearing them down. The
    callback itself is the caller's (the engine's `journal.append`, whose OSError
    is engine-wide journal semantics, deliberately unguarded here).

    detach_kept (branch_per=run only): when keep_failed preserves the worktree,
    detach its HEAD so the shared run branch it holds is freed for the next unit
    to mount — otherwise every later unit's `git worktree add` collides on the
    already-checked-out branch. Best effort; see the keep_failed branch below.
