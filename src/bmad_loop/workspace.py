"""Where code+git work happens, decoupled from where run state lives.

A Workspace pairs the directory sessions run in (and git operates on) with the
artifact paths rebased onto it. Run state (run_dir, journal, state.json) always
lives in the main repo and is passed separately — it never moves.

- isolation = none → Workspace.default(paths): root = paths.repo_root, behavior
  identical to operating directly on the project.
- isolation = worktree → per unit: a git worktree mounted under the run dir
  (.bmad-loop/runs/<run_id>/worktrees/, which `bmad-loop init` gitignores, so it
  stays invisible to the main checkout's `git status`), with paths rebased onto
  it. open_unit_workspace / close_unit_workspace manage the branch + worktree
  lifecycle; the engine merges the unit branch back into the target branch from
  the main repo between units.

    happens. On success (or failure without keep_failed) the worktree is removed

    Invariant: the teardown tail is post-merge/post-capture housekeeping — the

    before it runs, so no git teardown failure escapes it. Every `GitError` from
    the worktree removal or branch deletion degrades to a call of

    a clean or force-retried removal is silent (see the teardown tail below). A

    then hold the only copy of the unit's changes — so it is reported the same
    way but preserves the worktree + branch rather than tearing them down. The
