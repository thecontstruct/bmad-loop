        * `dispatched_spec_file` / `dispatched_spec_snapshot` are the ATTEMPT's
          binding, the pair `recovery_flow` restores bytes through. The attempt died

        Leaving `spec_file` absolute into the deleted mount is what made the fresh
        attempt start UNBOUND: `_dispatched_spec_for_attempt` resolves it
        `strict=True`, the dead path raises, and the miss is silent because an
        unbound attempt is a legal state. `_record_dev_spec` cannot repair it either
        — it no-ops while `spec_file` is set.

        Uses the same relativization as `to_dict`, so the discarded-mount spelling
        and the persisted one cannot drift, which also means a spec OUTSIDE the mount
        stays verbatim: it was never the mount's to give up. MUST be called while

        `recovery_flow.rollback_or_pause` running against the MAIN checkout. Neither

        baseline_untracked` as every untracked file in the operator's own checkout.

        Costs the re-run nothing: `_dev_phase` re-stamps both from whatever workspace

    # the failure is the run environment's, not the story's (verify command

    # Whether this PASSING outcome waived the dev gate's proof-of-work check on
    # the park leg (`verify_dev`'s two-part park selector fired). The fact of the
    # waiver, not its result: `Engine._verify_dev_artifacts` journals exactly the
    # attempts this is True for, so a park that got past the dev ARTIFACT gate
    # without proving work always leaves a trace there (#676).
    #
    # Scoped to that gate at both ends, and the bound is worth stating exactly.
    # This rides only the `passed()` return, so a leg that waived proof-of-work
    # and then failed a later check INSIDE `verify_dev` — the sprint pair is the
    # reachable one — records nothing; anything wider would need the flag on the
    # failing constructors too. It says nothing at all about the stages AFTER that
    # gate: the configured `[verify]` commands, decision routing, the review loop,
    # the pre-commit workflows and the commit all run later and may still reject
    # the attempt, which is then retried or deferred with its record already
    # written. So a True here means "the artifact gate was cleared with
    # proof-of-work waived", never "this park committed".
    park_proof_skipped: bool = False
    # An OBSERVATION, never a gate: on that same waived leg, what the skipped
    # proof-of-work gate WOULD have found, measured from the same baseline and
    # under the same exclusions it would have used. `True` = nothing it counts —
    # the residue was confined to what proof-of-work already excludes, the #676
    # shape the waiver exists for. `False` = it would have found changes. `None` =
    # the probe could not answer.
    #
    # `False` is a statement about the TREE, not about a session, and the wording
    # matters because the tempting shorthand ("the park wrote real code") is a
    # claim this seam cannot make: the gate it stands in for cannot attribute
    # residue to a session either — under `isolation = "none"` a commit that
    # arrived in the shared checkout from outside the session satisfies it — so
    # the observation inherits exactly that limit rather than improving on it.
    #
    # Three things produce `None`, all of them "the probe could not answer": a
    # `GitError` (it degrades rather than escalating), a git REFUSAL such as an
    # unresolvable baseline (any rc that is not one of git's two real answers, rc
    # 128 being the everyday one — `_changes_since` reports it as unknown instead
    # of letting the gate's fail-open record a confident `False`), and an
    # attempt with no `baseline_commit` to measure from. Nothing branches on any
    # of the three.
    #
    # The two fields are deliberately separate, and collapsing them is the bug
    # this pair exists to prevent: one says a gate was waived, the other says what
    # that gate would have found. Keyed on the observation alone, an unanswerable
    # probe is indistinguishable from no waiver at all — so a park whose probe
    # faulted would go unrecorded, re-creating exactly the silence this pair ends.
    # A waived gate is recorded whatever the probe managed to say; `None` is a
    # truthful field value, not a reason to withhold the record.
