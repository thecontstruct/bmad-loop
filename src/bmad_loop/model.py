# `list[Unknown]` / `dict[Unknown, Unknown]` (it does not fold the declared
# annotation back into the factory) though the fields are correctly typed.
# `reportUnknownArgumentType`: `from_dict` / snapshot readers pull values out of
# run-persisted `dict[str, Any]`, so isinstance-narrowing an `Any` value yields
# Unknown at that boundary. Both are inherent to the persistence edge, not
# annotation drift; every other strict rule stays on.
