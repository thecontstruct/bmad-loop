"""Model of sprint-status.yaml — the single source of workflow truth.

The dev primitive `bmad-build-auto` deliberately does not touch sprint-status
("the orchestrator's business"), so the orchestrator is the single writer via
:func:`advance` — idempotent, never-regress, epic-lift. The orchestrator
otherwise only re-reads this file to pick the next story and verify what a
session claims.

Concurrency (#286/#469): being the sole writer is not on its own mutual
exclusion — a second orchestrator process (another `bmad-loop run`, a sweep, the
TUI) runs the same sole writer, and :func:`advance` is a read-modify-write of the
whole board, so two of them would both read, both edit, and let the last atomic
write win. :func:`advance` therefore serializes itself cross-process on the
board's state-root sidecar lock, and holds it across every read that decides the
PUBLISHED BYTES as well as the write itself. That invariant is deliberately
narrower than "every read": one advisory pre-lock probe may answer a
read-dependent no-op — an absent row, or a row already at or past target —
without acquiring at all (#736), because such a call publishes nothing and so has
no bytes for the hold to protect. Readers stay lock-free: the publish is an
atomic replace, so a reader sees either the old board entire or the new one.

    The split between value and comment is two-stage: the key prefix is matched
    first and the whole remainder captured, then that remainder decides for
    itself. An unquoted value keeps the wide class this board needs — it
    legitimately contains spaces (`last_updated: 01-06-2026 10:00`), which is why
    it cannot borrow `frontmatter._VALUE_COMMENT_RE`'s conservative token gate —

    so a comment sitting after one is dropped rather than guessed at. Lossy,
    never wrong, and only a hand-edit reaches it: the writer replaces such a
    value with a bare token on the next advance.

    refresh `last_updated` when `now` is given. Comments/structure are preserved
    via line edits. Returns the story's status after the call (== `target` on a
    write), or None when nothing was eligible.

    The rewrite is atomic and symlink-following (#379), and every existing CRLF,
    LF, bare CR, or mixed per-line terminator is preserved (#576). The board is
    read as raw UTF-8 bytes, each edited line carries its own terminator, and
    `atomic_write_bytes` publishes the byte-exact result. This is a
    read-modify-rewrite of the board, and a truncating write that faults partway
    through corrupts it SILENTLY: YAML cut at a line boundary is still a valid
    mapping, just a smaller one, so the epics past the tear cease to exist rather
    than raising. AGENTS.md makes this the orchestrator's sole write path to
    sprint-status.yaml, so nothing downstream would contradict the shortened
    board — the run would simply walk off the end of the sprint. The atomic
    helper keeps the file entire: either the old contents or the whole new ones,
    never a prefix.

    Symlinks are FOLLOWED (the helper's default), which is what the old
    truncating write did too — the board is an operator-curated file at a
    project-relative path, and a repo that symlinks it somewhere must keep being
    a symlink. That rules out the confined writers, which are no-follow by
    construction: this site takes the #597 flag and nothing else.

    ``require_writable_target=True`` is that flag, and it restores what going
    atomic silently dropped: `os.replace` needs write permission on the parent
    DIRECTORY, never on the entry it replaces, so a board an operator had marked
    read-only was rewritten anyway — and because the mode is inherited it came
    back reading ``0444``, leaving nothing in the permission bits to record that
    it changed (#597). The truncating `write_bytes` this replaced raised
    `PermissionError` there as a side effect of opening the file; that refusal is
    a property worth keeping deliberately, because AGENTS.md makes this the
    orchestrator's SOLE write path to the board — a read-only board is the only
    way an operator can say "stop rewriting this", and it has to mean something.

    Serialized cross-process (#286/#469) on the board's advisory lock — the
    state-root sidecar :func:`~bmad_loop.runs.lock_path_for` names for it, not a
    sibling of the board itself, because the board is a tracked file and the
    engine's own ``git add -A`` would commit a sidecar beside it. The hold spans
    the whole read-modify-write and nothing else: three reads (the status probe,
    the raw bytes, the epic-lift ``load``) and the one atomic write, with no
    subprocess, session, or operator pause inside it (#286). That also closes the
    intra-call TOCTOU, since the never-regress decision and the bytes it is
    applied to now come from one hold rather than from two independent reads.

    Two answers are reached BEFORE the lock. The missing-board check runs first,
    so asking about a board that does not exist leaves no sidecar behind. Then an
    ADVISORY probe (#736) reads the row once and answers the two cases in which
    this call would write nothing at all: an absent row (``None``) and a row
    already at or past ``target`` (the current status, via :func:`_row_at_or_past`
    — the same predicate the locked body applies). Acquiring for those was the
    defect: an idempotent replay — ``bmad-loop confirm`` against a story the board
    already records as done is a designed path, not an error
    (:meth:`~bmad_loop.model.ParkedStory.resumable` accepts it), as is
    ``_carry_board_advance``'s routine no-op on a tracked board — could fail on
    lock contention, or on a :class:`~bmad_loop.runs.StateRootError` from
    :func:`~bmad_loop.runs.lock_path_for`, for work it was never going to do.

    The probe is advisory in the strict sense: only a "would write nothing"
    answer is acted on, and such a call simply linearizes at the probe's read
    rather than at an acquisition. Every other outcome — including ANY exception
    raised while probing — falls through to the locked path, which re-reads,
    re-decides authoritatively and raises on the channel it always did. So the
    probe can neither authorize a write nor add a failure mode the hold lacks: a
    malformed board still raises :class:`SprintStatusError` from under the lock.
    ``now`` needs no handling here, because both no-op arms of
    :func:`_advance_locked` return before the ``last_updated`` write; a
    probe-satisfied early-out is write-equivalent to the locked answer.

    Acquisition failure — for the calls that do reach the lock — surfaces as
    ``OSError`` (or :class:`~bmad_loop.runs.StateRootError` when no state root can
    be derived) on the channel callers already route this function's raises
    through — the engine's crash/escalation handling, the CLI's failure exit — so
    a board that could not be serialized fails loudly rather than being rewritten
    unlocked. :func:`advanced_bytes` deliberately does NOT come through
    here: it calls :func:`_advance_locked` against a private throwaway copy, so it
    neither contends on the real board's sidecar nor mints one of its own.

    Goes through ``story_status`` against a throwaway copy, like
    :func:`advanced_bytes` above and for its reason: the full YAML resolution and the
    ``LEGACY_STORY_STATUSES`` folding ARE what makes two rows "the same status", and a
    second reading of them would drift from the one every other caller uses.

    Returns None when the row is absent. A board that does not parse raises
    ``SprintStatusError``, exactly as ``story_status`` does — "I could not read it"
    must not reach a caller spelled as "the row is gone".
