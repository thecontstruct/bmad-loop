"""The library-level read-model projection layer for the ``--json`` contract.

Domain object in, contract document dict out. Every builder here is a pure
projection — it reads an already-loaded domain object (a ``ValidationReport``, a
``RunState``, a list of ``Decision`` / ``RunInfo``) and returns the plain dict
that :mod:`bmad_loop.machine` serializes. No I/O, no process state, no printing,
no exit codes: the caller loads, this layer projects, ``machine.emit`` writes.

Each command owns its own ``*_SCHEMA_VERSION`` constant and obeys the pure-document
contract documented in :mod:`bmad_loop.machine` — one JSON object, additive-only
evolution, anything breaking bumps that command's version. Those constants live
here, next to the builders they version, because a field and its version bump are
one edit.

This mirrors the split :mod:`bmad_loop.probe` and :mod:`bmad_loop.diagnostics`
already make — one finding, two render targets — generalized to the commands whose
document is a dict rather than a rendered string. The point of the separation is
that the contract is not a CLI feature: a future non-CLI frontend (the planned web
backend) imports these builders directly and serializes them itself, never
shelling out to the CLI to parse its stdout. Keeping them in ``cli.py`` made the
library surface reachable only through ``argparse``, and made every new command's
document another few hundred lines of accretion in the dispatch module.

So: add a new command's builder here, not in ``cli.py``. ``cli.py`` re-imports
these names, which is what keeps ``cli.STATUS_SCHEMA_VERSION`` and friends
resolving for existing callers and tests.

Every name in this module is public, and a new builder must be too: the
projection surface *is* the API, so a leading underscore would say "do not
import this" about the one thing the module exists to be imported for. The
builders carried one until #212 only because they were born private inside
``cli.py``. ``run_token_totals`` is public for the same reason even though it
projects no document of its own — ``cmd_status`` calls it across the module
boundary to render text, and a private name imported by another module is the
contradiction this module is meant not to have. Keep genuinely intra-module
helpers private, as :mod:`bmad_loop.probe` and :mod:`bmad_loop.diagnostics` do.

    """The `validate --json` document: the verdict plus every check that produced it.

    Obeys the pure-document contract in machine.py (additive-only evolution;
    anything breaking bumps VALIDATE_SCHEMA_VERSION). ``ok`` is true when no
    finding has severity ``problem`` — warnings do not clear it — so it mirrors
    the exit code exactly. This is the first ``--json`` command that emits a whole
    document at rc 1: the nonzero code is the verdict being reported, not a
    failure to produce one (see machine.py on parsing non-empty stdout whatever
    the exit code).

    Four things a consumer has to know:

    - **``message`` is not contracted.** Several problems are a bare ``str(e)``
      from the config, policy, profile and sprint-status exceptions, so their
      wording moves with those modules. ``check`` is the only matchable identity;
      match on it, and read ``message``/``detail`` for humans.
    - **Absence is not a pass.** The gates are chained: if policy fails to load,
      ``profiles`` is empty and the binary, hook and base-skill gates contribute
      no finding at all. A check id missing from ``findings`` means "did not run",
      never "passed" — check ``ok`` for the verdict, not the absence of an id.
    - **``mux.backends-detected`` is gated on more than one registered backend**,
      so a lone-tmux host carries no backend inventory. Same rule as above. The one
      exception to its ``ok`` severity is a detection failure, which reports under
      the same id at ``warning`` and carries no ``detail`` at all — read the
      severity, never index ``detail["backends"]`` without a null check.
    - **``mux.selection`` is not gated on the reason.** It used to appear only for a
      forced ``env``/``policy`` choice and now names the reason wherever selection
      resolves. It is absent whenever no backend row is *selected*, which has three
      causes: a forced name matching no registered backend (``mux.preflight``
      carries that failure), a detection failure (the ``warning`` above carries
      it), and ``_select`` bottoming out at its historical tmux fallback with tmux
      unregistered (nothing else reports that — the inventory simply holds no
      selected row). Same rule as above.

    ``findings`` stays flat and in emission order rather than grouped by severity:
    grouping would destroy the cross-severity ordering (the order the gates ran)
    and turn "every non-ok finding" into a two-array concatenation.

    Obeys the pure-document contract in machine.py (additive-only evolution;
    anything breaking bumps CLEANUP_SCHEMA_VERSION). Plan and outcome share one
    shape: the lists mean the same thing either way and `dry_run` alone says
    whether it happened, so a caller can diff a preview against the real run.
    `sessions.removed` holds run ids (the session name is `bmad-loop-<id>`),
    `ctl_windows.removed` holds window names. `unverifiable_pid` is the subset
    of `sessions.removed` whose engine liveness could not be proven — the text
    mode's stderr warning, carried in the document so JSON mode leaves stderr
    empty. It never blocks cleanup: pruning kills the tmux session, never the
    engine pid. Nothing to clean up is a valid document of empty lists at
    exit 0, never an error.

    `ctl_windows` is a three-way partition, disjoint by window id (the values
    are names): `removed` was verified gone after the kill, `survived` was still
    listed, and `unverifiable` is a kill whose outcome could not be probed at
    all. Schema 2 narrowed `removed` from "a kill was attempted" to "the window
    is verifiably gone" (#435) — a meaning change, hence the version bump rather
    than a bare field addition. Under `--dry-run` nothing is killed, so `removed`
    is the would-close plan and the other two are empty — the shared
    plan/outcome shape holds, with `dry_run` still the field that says which one
    you are holding.

    `ctl_windows.scan_error` is the candidate scan failing before any window was
    chosen or killed: the three arms are empty and mean "no answer", not
    "verified empty". Without it, a failed preflight is indistinguishable from a
    clean scan that found nothing — automation reading the document would accept
    the empty partition and skip cleanup it still owes. The `unverifiable_pid`
    precedent: the degradation travels in the document, not only on stderr.
    `null` when the scan reported no failure — which is as much as this document
    can promise: the seam's listing call degrades a transport fault to an empty
    listing by contract (the sentinel-returner half of the multiplexer seam), so
    that one fault mode still reads as an empty scan. The same documented
    ceiling as prune_ctl_windows' post-kill probe; narrowing it is seam work,
    not a document field.

    `sessions.legacy_leftovers` is the migration's remainder: session NAMES (not
    run ids — the control session has no run id) that a legacy multiplexer
    registry still holds and that cleanup deliberately did not remove. Additive,
    so no schema bump: a consumer that does not know the key reads exactly what it
    read before. Empty on every platform and every already-migrated machine. See
    `runs.legacy_registry_leftovers` for what qualifies and why; the text mode
    prints the same list on stderr, the `unverifiable_pid` precedent.

    `sessions.removed` did NOT get the same treatment and is still the pre-kill
    prunable partition — an *attempted* kill, since `kill_session` is best-effort
    and silent in exactly the way `kill_window` is. #435 narrowed the windows
    half only; read the sessions half with that in mind.

    shape: the lists mean the same thing either way and `dry_run` alone says
    whether it happened, so a caller can diff a preview against the real run.

    `freed_bytes` is a raw integer — the text mode's `~1.2MB` is a rendering of
    this number, and formatting is the renderer's job. It is the same estimate
    the text prints: measured before mutating (so it holds under --dry-run) and
    approximate by construction, since it sums whole run dirs for archive/delete
    but only the trimmed scaffolding (`runs.heavy_run_entries`) for a trim.

    Every list names items the text enumerates or counts: `worktrees` holds
    absolute worktree paths, the rest hold run ids. `protected` is the runs left
    untouched — `--keep`-listed, non-terminal, or carrying a live agent session,
    which protects a run wherever it sits relative to the retention window
    (reclaiming it would strand the session, #419) — which the text reports only
    as a count. `unverifiable_pid` is the subset
    of touched runs whose engine liveness could not be proven; it is the text
    mode's stderr warning, carried in the document so JSON mode leaves stderr
    empty, and it never blocks reclamation.

    `policy.retain` is the *effective* window — `--retain` when given, else
    `[cleanup] run_retention`. The other three are the configured policy as
    loaded. Note `--hard` overrides `archive_old` for this invocation only, so
    it does not change the reported value; the outcome shows in `deleted`.

    `state_dirs_swept` counts the orphaned out-of-tree control-plane dirs the
    invocation reclaimed (#494) — run state dirs under the user-scoped state root
    with no run dir left to own them. A count rather than a list, because that is
    exactly what the text mode reports and the paths name a location outside the
    project that no caller acts on per-item. It is an additive field on the
    existing schema version: a v1 consumer reads every field it already knew.
    Those dirs hold only consumed event files, so their bytes are not in
    `freed_bytes` — an accepted under-count of a few kilobytes at most.
