"""per_worktree setup for the bmad-loop Unity engine plugin.

Runs once per unit, right after bmad-loop cuts the unit's git worktree and before
the readiness gate, to turn that fresh checkout into a usable Unity project with
its own managed Editor:

  1. Give the worktree a *warm* ``Library`` by reflink/CoW-copying the project's
     main ``Library`` into it (NOT the operator's live Library directly, and NOT a
     symlink to it — sharing one Library across two Editors corrupts it). A fresh
     worktree has no Library (it is gitignored, so never checked out); opening Unity
     on an empty Library forces a *cold full reimport* of the whole project, which on
     a real project melts the import workers and SIGFPEs Burst mid-artifact-write
     (the "Opening file VirtualArtifacts/Primary/<hash>" crash). Seeding a warm
     Library makes it an *incremental* reimport of just the changed assets instead.
     On a CoW filesystem (btrfs/xfs) the copy is near-instant and shares extents, so
     it costs almost no time or disk; elsewhere it falls back to a deep copy, then to
     a symlinked empty per-worktree cache (the old behavior) if no warm source exists.
  2. Write the worktree's MCP client config via ``setup-mcp`` for *every* agent that
     runs in the worktree (dev + review may be different CLIs, each reading its own
     config file — ``.mcp.json`` for claude, ``.codex/config.toml`` for codex, …)
     and pin the *Unity project* to local ("Custom") mode via ``bootstrap-local``.
     The IvanMurzak CLI derives a deterministic MCP port from the *project path*, so
     a worktree at a different path automatically gets its own port and self-isolates
     from the operator's main Editor with no manual port wiring. Each agent's config
     is then verified to point at that port — a worktree-local config seeded from the
     main repo (pinned to the main project's port) would otherwise silently route the
     agent's asset writes into the main checkout, so a mismatch fails the hook.
  3. Launch a Unity Editor on the worktree path (detached) **with local-connection
     env** so it connects to that per-path local server and *hosts the server
     itself* (``--start-server true``) rather than the cloud. The plugin's
     ``ready_cmd`` (the engine's readiness gate) then blocks until that Editor +
     server are up, so this script only needs to start it, not wait for it.

Why custom/local mode matters: a bare ``open`` passes no MCP connection env, so the
Editor falls back to its persisted config (cloud by default) — the worktree Editor
then isn't talking to its per-worktree server at all. And without ``--start-server
true`` the local server only exists once an MCP *client* (the agent) spawns it, so
the readiness gate can't observe it before the agent runs. Pinning Custom mode +
Editor-hosted server fixes both: the Editor connects locally and readiness becomes
observable without any client. (A loopback ``--url`` is what flips the Editor off
cloud; ``bootstrap-local`` persists ``connectionMode: Custom`` in the project's
``UserSettings/AI-Game-Developer-Config.json`` so the Editor UI shows it too.)

The MCP tool *skill* files are not written here — they are gitignored and copied
in from the main repo by the plugin's ``seed_globs`` (``.claude/skills/*``).

Verified against unity-mcp-cli v0.81.1 (`setup-mcp` writes ``.mcp.json`` with the
deterministic local URL; `bootstrap-local --url --token` pins Custom mode; `open`
injects UNITY_MCP_* env only when connection options are passed). The exact flags
move between releases — override engine.worktree_setup_cmd in a project-local
plugin if yours differ.

Only the IvanMurzak MCP is wired for a managed per-worktree launch. CoplayDev runs
one shared :8080 server multiplexing Editors by instance id, so its per-worktree
story differs — point engine.worktree_setup_cmd at your own script for it.

Env (injected by the engine, all optional except the worktree):
  BMAD_LOOP_WORKTREE         the unit's worktree (the Unity project to manage)
  BMAD_LOOP_REPO_ROOT        main repo root (parent of the Library cache)
  BMAD_LOOP_ENGINE_MCP       ivanmurzak | coplaydev            (default ivanmurzak)
  BMAD_LOOP_UNITY_PATH       explicit Editor binary            (skips Unity Hub discovery)
  BMAD_LOOP_ENGINE_AGENTS    comma-separated setup-mcp agent ids to point at the
                             worktree Editor — every CLI that runs here, dev AND
                             review (auto-wired by the engine from the loaded
                             profiles; default claude-code)
  BMAD_LOOP_ENGINE_AGENT     legacy single-agent fallback for the above
  BMAD_LOOP_UNITY_LIBRARY_CACHE  override the symlink-fallback Library cache root
  BMAD_LOOP_UNITY_LIBRARY_SEED   warm Library to prime from   (default <repo>/Library;
                                 empty string disables priming → symlink fallback)
  BMAD_LOOP_UNITY_LIBRARY_SEED_MODE  reflink | copy | symlink | off   (default reflink)
  UNITY_MCP_CLI              IvanMurzak CLI binary             (default unity-mcp-cli)

Local-connection knobs (defaults reproduce the recommended Custom/local launch):
  BMAD_LOOP_UNITY_MCP_LOCAL          1/true to pin Custom mode (default); 0/false
                                     reverts to a bare cloud-config ``open``
  BMAD_LOOP_UNITY_MCP_URL            local server URL (default: read from .mcp.json)
  BMAD_LOOP_UNITY_MCP_TOKEN          bearer token (default empty — auth none)
  BMAD_LOOP_UNITY_MCP_TRANSPORT      streamableHttp | stdio   (default streamableHttp)
  BMAD_LOOP_UNITY_MCP_AUTH           none | required          (default none)
  BMAD_LOOP_UNITY_MCP_START_SERVER   true | false             (default true)
  BMAD_LOOP_UNITY_MCP_KEEP_CONNECTED true | false             (default true)

Exit 0 = the worktree Editor is launching; non-zero = setup failed (the engine
defers the unit and notifies).
