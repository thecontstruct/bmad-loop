"""Seed the Unity scene auto-save guard into a bmad-loop-driven project.

Unity-MCP GameObject tools mark a scene dirty but never save it, so a project
driven by the shared editor accumulates a chronically dirty scene. That dirty
state is what raises the two run-stalling modal dialogs ("scene changed on disk —
reload?" when git/an agent rewrites the open .unity file, and "save changes before
quitting?" on editor exit). A modal freezes ``EditorApplication.update`` — which
the MCP plugin uses to dispatch tool calls — so every MCP call then times out.

This helper copies an editor-only auto-save guard (``SceneAutoSaveGuard.cs`` + its
asmdef, with pre-generated ``.meta`` files carrying fixed GUIDs) into the project's
``Assets`` tree so the editor's very first import already sees it. It is invoked by
the Unity plugin *before* ``unity_setup.py`` launches the per_worktree Editor, and
at the readiness gate in shared mode (where ``unity_setup.py`` never runs).

The install is idempotent and version-aware: it copies the payload only when the
target ``.cs`` is absent or its ``bmad-loop-scene-guard-version`` header is older
than the payload's. It never deletes or rewrites any file it did not ship, and a
missing asset tree is a graceful skip (not every worktree is a Unity project yet).

The seeded guard is committed into the consumer project by story-finalize's
``git add -A`` — that is intended: the guard travels with the repo so any editor
that opens the project is protected. Because seeding happens pre-baseline (before
the unit's untracked-file baseline is snapshotted), ``verify.safe_rollback`` never
treats it as a created-this-unit file and never deletes it.

Env (injected by the Unity plugin):
  BMAD_LOOP_WORKTREE                    project root (Assets = <worktree>/Assets)
  BMAD_LOOP_UNITY_INSTALL_SCENE_GUARD   "1" (default) enables; "0"/false skips
  BMAD_LOOP_UNITY_SCENE_GUARD_DIR       install dir  (default Assets/BmadLoop/Editor)

Exit 0 = seeded, already-current, or a benign skip (disabled / no asset tree);
non-zero = a real error (no worktree, unreadable payload, a failed copy).
