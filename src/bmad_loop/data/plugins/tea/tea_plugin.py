"""In-process brain for the bundled Test Architect Enterprise (TEA) plugin.

The plugin's behaviour is mostly declarative — six ``[workflows.*]`` inject TEA
sessions at ``post_dev_phase`` / ``pre_commit_gate``, and the generic
workflow-overlay convention (``<name>_enabled`` / ``<name>_blocking``) turns the
per-step settings into enable/blocking switches with no code. This module owns
the two things that need logic:

  * the **readiness gate** (``validate``) — fail the run fast, with an actionable
    remediation message, when ``require_tea`` is on but the project has no TEA
    install, so an operator who enabled the plugin without installing TEA learns
    immediately instead of watching every injected session flail.
  * **blocking-gate enforcement** (``on_pre_commit``) — when an operator marks a
    gate step blocking (``trace_blocking`` / ``nfr_blocking`` / ``review_blocking``
    = true), parse that gate's latest TEA artifact at commit time and, on a
    FAIL/CONCERNS verdict, escalate the unit (``ctx.veto("pause", …)``) instead of
    letting it land. ``pre_commit`` is the first vetoable stage *after* the
    ``pre_commit_gate`` workflows have written their artifacts, and both fire
    unconditionally on every path into a commit — review-converged, skip-review
    (``review.trigger="recommended"`` with no follow-up recommended), and the
    review-budget rescue — so the gates evaluate the exact tree about to commit.

Enforcement is **fail-open by design**: if a gate has no blocking flag, no
artifact, or an artifact that can't be parsed into a known verdict, the commit is
never blocked. An unknown format must never wrongly stop a commit — only a
confidently-parsed FAIL/CONCERNS on an operator-marked-blocking gate escalates.
