"""PII-scrubbing chokepoint for `bmad-loop probe-adapter` and `bmad-loop diagnose`.

Pure stdlib, no bmad_loop imports — the single audited place that decides what
data from a foreign CLI (or a user's own run dir) is safe to show a maintainer.
Both the probe and the diagnostic-dump commands route every captured payload,
help/version blob, discovered path, and run-state value through here before
rendering; nothing is displayed raw.

Guarantees:
- token *counts* are non-PII, so numbers/bools/null pass through verbatim;
- dict **keys** get the same scrub as leaf strings (a home-path or
  credential-shaped key can't leak where the equivalent value would be caught);
  every leaf **string** is `$HOME`-redacted and then kept ONLY if it matches a
  conservative identifier shape (a short slug with no spaces / `@` / `/`, e.g.
  ``claude-opus-4-8`` or ``session-abc_123``); anything else (prose, code,
  paths, emails) becomes ``<redacted:str>``;
- an identifier-shaped string that looks like a **secret** (a known credential
  prefix such as ``ghp_``/``sk-``/``AKIA``, a JWT, or a long high-entropy blob)
  becomes ``<redacted:secret>`` even though it would otherwise pass — the one
  hole the identifier shape would leave open;
- list lengths are preserved (the count is structural, the contents aren't);
- recursion is depth-guarded so a pathological payload can't blow the stack.

It also owns the shared egress backstop both commands run over their own
rendered bytes before emitting: :class:`Pseudonymizer` (stable, irreversible
per-report aliases for proprietary identifiers — story keys, branches, SHAs,
project names — that *are* identifier-shaped and so would otherwise survive
verbatim), :func:`assert_no_leak` (the raw re-scan; accepts labeled extras
``(value, label)`` so a hit is reported by a printable label instead of an
opaque index), and :func:`guard` / :func:`assert_clean` (the fail-closed
policy around it: hard-rule hits — email/secret/home-path/url-creds/username —
refuse outright by raising :class:`LeakDetected`, while a stray pseudonymizer
original is repaired via :func:`replace_standalone` under identical
word-boundary semantics, re-verified, and disclosed to the caller). A routing
bug or a future field can therefore never silently ship a secret/PII/path.

# form let a Windows home path through the JSON render untouched, so the
# separator alternates one-or-two backslashes. POSIX prefixes need no such
# treatment: `/` is not escaped by JSON.
#
# The drive-letter arm is for BACKSLASHES only, deliberately: the forward-slash
# Windows form (`C:/Users/alice`, from Path.as_posix or MSYS-ish tooling) already
# matches the `/Users/` arm as a substring, as does git-bash's `/c/Users/alice`.
# Widening the drive-letter arm to `[\\/]` buys only the mixed-separator oddity
# `C:\Users/alice` — and any string carrying a separator at all is rejected by
# looks_like_identifier upstream and redacted before it can reach here.
#
# The backslash `home`/`root` arm is for the Windows→WSL UNC bridge (#512):
# `\\wsl.localhost\<distro>\home\<user>`, the legacy `\\wsl$\...`, and the
# extended-length `\\?\UNC\wsl.localhost\...` folding all reach a POSIX home
# directory whose separators are BACKSLASHES, so none of the forward-slash arms
# can see them. That shape needs a path rule for a second reason: the identifier
# at risk is the *Linux* username, while the username rule in assert_no_leak
# compares `getpass.getuser()` — the *Windows* account — so on a native-Windows
# interpreter reaching a distro path, no other rule can fire on the name that
# matters. The arm anchors on the home segment rather than the `wsl` host
# because a host anchor misses `\\?\UNC\wsl.localhost\...` entirely: the
# `?\UNC\` segment sits between the leading backslashes and `wsl`. `Users` is
# deliberately NOT in this arm — it stays behind the drive-letter arm above,
# which is the bound the preceding paragraph justifies.
# tests/test_sanitize.py::test_assert_no_leak_fires pins each arm;

    The naive cut is at ``max_chars``. That is unsafe when it lands INSIDE
    something :func:`assert_no_leak` would have flagged, because the fragment it
    leaves behind can keep the sensitive part while no longer tripping the rule
    — turning a fail-closed refusal into an emission. Two shapes reach here:

    * a credential-shaped token, where the entropy arm of
      :func:`looks_like_secret` needs a contiguous alnum run of
      ``_SECRET_RUN_MIN``, so clipping a 36-character token to 30 leaves a
      credential prefix the guard no longer recognizes; and
    * a URL credential, whose match ends at the ``@`` — clip that off and
      ``_URL_CRED_RE`` stops matching while the password prefix still ships.

    Rather than special-case either, the cut retracts out of any
    ``_TRUNCATION_HAZARD_RES`` match it splits whose whole trips the guard while
    its surviving prefix does not, using :func:`assert_no_leak` itself as the
    oracle. Deferring to the guard is what keeps this general: it is the same
    verdict the rendered bytes are judged by, so a rule added there is covered
    here without a second implementation of what "sensitive" means.

    That verdict test is also what keeps the cap from over-firing. ``"x" * 5000``
    is a single 5000-character token, but it trips no rule whole OR clipped, so
    it still truncates at exactly ``max_chars``; a ``ghp_``-prefixed token is
    matched at its start and still trips the guard once clipped, so it is not
    retracted either and the refusal is preserved with no content dropped (#481).

    What this does NOT cover, deliberately: the guard's rules keyed on values
    only the CALLER knows. ``assert_no_leak`` is consulted here without its
    ``extra`` argument, so a caller-supplied sensitive value is not considered,
    and the hazard patterns need six characters, so a standalone username at the
    guard's five-character floor is matched by neither. Splitting one of those
    still costs the guard its verdict. Closing that needs the caller's values
    threaded into this function, which is tracked separately (#654) rather than
    widened into #481 — this bounds the cap to the guard's STATIC rules.
