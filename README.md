# bmad-loop

<div align="center">

**A deterministic ralph-loop orchestrator for the [BMAD-METHOD](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD) implementation phase**

Plain Python drives the loop — **pick story → implement → adversarially review → verify → commit** — while LLMs do only the creative work, inside disposable, fresh-context coding-agent sessions you can attach to and watch.

## Why bmad-loop

Inspired by the original [bmad-automator](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/bmad-automator) (a separate, legacy project), it takes a token-optimized approach in which the orchestrator is ordinary code rather than an LLM session in the control loop:

- 🧠 **No LLM in the control loop.** Story selection, retry budgets, gates, and completion checks are code, not prompts — so they're deterministic, debuggable, and free.
- 📡 **No pane-scraping.** Coding-agent hooks (`Stop` / `SessionStart` / `SessionEnd` / `PreCompact`) write structured event files the orchestrator watches; skills in automation mode write a machine-readable `result.json` at the end of each workflow.
- 🔍 **Trust nothing, verify everything.** After each session the orchestrator checks artifacts on disk: spec frontmatter status, baseline-commit match (recorded independently — a cheap LLM-lie detector), non-empty diff, sprint-status sync, and _your_ test/lint commands before any commit.
- 📒 **One source of truth.** `sprint-status.yaml` is owned by the BMAD skills; the orchestrator only ever reads it.
- 🪟 **Fresh context per step.** Dev and review are separate sessions — review never inherits the implementer's context, so there's no anchoring bias.
- ♻️ **Resumable & multi-agent.** Every run is a resumable state machine on disk, and a generic tmux adapter drives `claude`, `codex`, or `gemini` (mix per stage).
- 🌿 **Optional worktree isolation.** Opt in (`[scm] isolation = "worktree"`) and each story runs in its own git worktree/branch and merges back locally — your main checkout stays free while a run is in flight.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.11+**, **tmux**, and a supported coding CLI — `claude` by default; `codex` and `gemini` via [profiles](#other-coding-clis).
- **Linux or macOS** (or **Windows via WSL**, which _is_ Linux — it runs as-is). tmux is the one terminal-multiplexer backend today, but it now sits behind a pluggable **registry** of OS seams (transport, process lifecycle, hook interpreter), so a native-Windows backend slots in as new files + a registration line each, with no engine edits — see [Porting bmad-loop to a new OS](docs/porting-to-a-new-os.md). Native Windows is not yet shipped.
- A **BMAD v6 project** (`_bmad/bmm/config.yaml`, a `sprint-status.yaml` from `bmad-sprint-planning`) with the upstream `bmad-dev-auto` skill and the bmad-loop skill module from this repo installed (`bmad-loop-resolve`, `bmad-loop-sweep` — see [Installing the skill module](#installing-the-skill-module)). Standard BMAD skills stay untouched.

## Quick start

```bash
uv sync --extra tui              # core is pyyaml-only; [tui] adds the dashboard

cd /path/to/your/bmad/project
bmad-loop init                   # installs bmad-loop-* skills + hooks + .bmad-loop/policy.toml + gitignore
bmad-loop validate               # preflight: config, sprint-status, git, tmux, CLI, hooks
bmad-loop run --dry-run          # print the plan without spawning anything
bmad-loop run                    # go
bmad-loop tui                    # …or drive everything from the dashboard
```

> **One-time setup:** if the coding CLI has never run in the target project, start it once (`claude`) and accept the workspace-trust dialog (and any hooks-approval prompt) before `bmad-loop run`. Spawned sessions can't answer first-run dialogs, and a pending dialog reads as a session timeout to the orchestrator.

| `bmad-loop decisions`                                    | Answer deferred-work decisions earlier sweeps left unanswered (skipped by `--no-prompt`, or an abandoned interactive sweep). Recorded so the next sweep acts on them without re-asking. `--list` shows them without answering.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| `bmad-loop status [<run-id>]`                            | Run + sprint summary with per-story token totals (plus a count of decisions awaiting an answer). A stories-mode run instead prints its stories board — id, live on-disk state, checkpoint markers, title.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `bmad-loop diagnose [<run-id>]` (`diag`)                 | Emit a **sanitized** diagnostic dump of a run/sweep to hand maintainers when reporting a bug — phase/token/session histograms, escalation counts, adapter/model, env, and run-dir file sizes, with no code, spec content, prompts, transcripts, paths, or PII. Identifiers are pseudonymized to stable per-dump aliases and the output is re-scanned by a fail-closed leak check before writing. Defaults to the latest run. `--all`, `--out`, `--json`, `--max-journal-entries N`. |

| `bmad-loop cleanup`                                      | Remove leftover tmux artifacts **for the current project**: kill `bmad-loop-<id>` sessions for finished/stopped/interrupted runs (and orphans whose run dir is gone) and close parked `bmad-loop-ctl` windows. `--dry-run` lists without killing. Live runs — and any session/window belonging to another project — are never touched.                                                                                                                                              |
| `bmad-loop clean`                                        | Reclaim **disk** from concluded runs per `[cleanup]`: tear down git worktrees a mid-flight stop orphaned (freeing their Unity `Library/` + MCP-server builds), trim the heavy `worktrees/` tree from runs kept for history (they stay viewable in the TUI), and archive/delete runs past the retention window. Only finished/stopped runs are touched; `--dry-run` previews, `--keep <run-id>` protects, `--retain N` overrides the window, `--hard` deletes instead of archiving.  |
| `bmad-loop tui`                                          | The interactive dashboard (needs the `[tui]` extra). `--low-frame-rate` caps it to 15fps + disables animations (fixes repaint tearing over slow/SSH links; also `[tui] low_frame_rate`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `bmad-loop probe-adapter <cli>` (`collect-adapter-data`) | Collect + sanitize the data needed to finalize a CLI adapter profile (hook payload shape, transcript location/format, token schema). Default is a zero-launch **scan**; `--probe` opts into a live capture. `--transcript`, `--session-dir`, `--binary` (CLIs with no profile yet), `--out`, `--json`. See the [adapter authoring guide](docs/adapter-authoring-guide.md).                                                                                                          |

Every command takes `--project <dir>` (default: the current directory). Any `<run-id>` may be a
partial — the tail after the last `-` (e.g. `a1b2`), shortened to any prefix that stays unique;
`bmad-loop list` shows each run's short ref.

## The TUI

```bash
uv sync --extra tui       # textual + tomlkit + pyte
bmad-loop tui
```

A live, read-only dashboard over everything below — and a launcher for new runs. It's the fastest way to understand what the orchestrator is doing.

### Dashboard

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/images/dashboard.png" alt="Dashboard: runs table, run header with token totals, per-story phase table, sprint tree, deferred-work ledger, and the journal tab." width="880">
</div>

The left column stacks the **runs table** (newest auto-selected; a per-run pause badge tags paused runs by kind, and the title carries a global _⚑ N need attention_ count), an expandable **sprint tree** (epics → stories/retro, completed items checked green) — replaced by a **stories board** (id · live disk state · spec/done checkpoint markers · title) when the selected run is in stories mode — and the **deferred-work ledger** (severity colour-coded). The right column shows the selected run's **header** (status, epic, task counts, cost-weighted token total), a **per-story table** (phase · dev attempts · review cycles · tokens · commit/defer info), and tabs tailing the **journal**, the active session's **pane log**, and the **ATTENTION** file. On a paused run, **`p`** opens the stage-appropriate HITL viewer — a plan-checkpoint spec viewer (Approve & resume / Request replan), a story-checkpoint summary card (Continue / Stop), the escalation view with story context (Resolve / Re-arm & resume), or a gate spec viewer — each calling the exact code paths the CLI uses.

### A sweep blocked on a human decision

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/images/sweep-decision.png" alt="A sweep run showing a yellow 'decision needed' banner and the decision-pending journal event." width="880">
</div>

Sweeps run as their own `[sweep]`-tagged runs. When an attended sweep hits a "needs human decision" item it blocks on its own terminal prompt; the dashboard spots the `decision-pending` journal event and raises a banner + toast — press **`a`** to attach to the sweep's window, answer, and detach.

### Answering decisions a past sweep left unanswered

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/images/decision-answer.png" alt="A modal answering deferred-work decision DW-1, with the question, context, and build/keep-open/close options (recommended marked)." width="880">
</div>

Unattended sweeps (`--no-prompt`) skip decisions, and an attended one can be abandoned mid-way — those answers would otherwise be lost. The Deferred Work pane shows the outstanding count (**`— N to answer (d)`**); press **`d`** (or run `bmad-loop decisions`) to walk each one. A `close` is applied immediately; a `build` / `keep-open` is saved to `.bmad-loop/decisions.json` and consumed by the next sweep with no re-prompt.

### Deferred-work entry & the start-run modal

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/images/deferred-modal.png" alt="A modal showing the full body of deferred-work entry DW-1." width="430">
<img src="docs/images/start-run-modal.png" alt="The start-run modal with epic, story, max-stories, and dry-run fields." width="430">
</div>

`enter` on any ledger row opens the full entry; `r` / `s` open modals to launch a run or sweep (epic, story, max-stories, dry-run). The start-run modal also carries a **source select** (sprint vs. stories mode, prefilled from `[stories]`) and a spec-folder field with a live schedule preview that validates `stories.yaml` and lists the linear schedule with checkpoint markers.

### The policy editor

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/images/settings.png" alt="The settings screen editing .bmad-loop/policy.toml, grouped by section with defaults shown as placeholders." width="880">
</div>

Press **`g`** to edit `.bmad-loop/policy.toml` in a form grouped by section — comment-preserving (tomlkit), validated with the engine's own parser before saving, with unset keys showing their defaults as placeholders. Every section starts collapsed with a one-line description; **`ctrl+e`** expands/collapses all at once.

### Key bindings

| Key       | Action                                                                                                   |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `r` / `s` | start a run / sweep (modal for epic, story, max-stories, dry-run…)                                       |
| `e`       | resume the selected paused/interrupted run                                                               |
| `p`       | review the selected paused run in the stage-appropriate viewer (plan/story checkpoint, gate, escalation) |
| `R`       | resolve a run paused at an escalation (interactive, then re-arm)                                         |
| `d`       | answer deferred-work decisions past sweeps left unanswered                                               |
| `a`       | attach to the live agent session (or the orchestrator window)                                            |
| `x`       | stop the selected live run (engine + agent session)                                                      |
| `D` / `A` | delete / archive the selected run (force-stops a live run first)                                         |
| `c`       | clean up tmux sessions/windows for finished & stopped runs                                               |
| `v`       | run `bmad-loop validate`, output in a modal                                                              |
| `g`       | settings editor for `.bmad-loop/policy.toml`                                                             |
| `y`       | copy the active Log/Attention pane to the clipboard                                                      |
| `M` / `q` | toggle theme (light/dark mode) / quit                                                                    |

**The TUI is an observer/launcher, never the engine.** Runs started with `r`/`s` are detached `bmad-loop` processes in windows of a dedicated tmux session (`bmad-loop-ctl`), so they survive a TUI exit or crash; the dashboard watches runs purely through the run-dir artifacts the engine writes atomically, so runs started from a plain shell show up identically. Launch and attach need tmux; the dashboard itself does not. Pid-based liveness is local-only — a run whose engine died shows `interrupted` (press `e`); runs on other hosts show `unknown`.

## Two planning pipelines, one loop

bmad-loop drives the same dev → verify → review → commit loop from **either** of two story sources — chosen per project, or per run:

- **Sprint mode (default).** Stories come from `sprint-status.yaml` (written by `bmad-sprint-planning` from your PRD/epics). The loop walks the board by `ready-for-dev` status, keyed by story ref (`1-2-account-mgmt`). This is what the rest of this README describes.
- **Stories mode (opt-in).** Stories come from a typed `stories.yaml` — the **Story Breakdown** output of `bmad-spec`, a fixed-name sibling of `SPEC.md` in the epic's spec folder. The loop dispatches each entry by **folder + id** (`/bmad-dev-auto Spec folder: <folder>. Story id: <id>.`); the dev skill creates-or-resumes the story spec at `<folder>/stories/<id>-<slug>.md`, and the orchestrator reads that id-keyed path back deterministically — no shared board to line-edit, no mtime-scan of result artifacts.

Turn it on per project with `[stories] source = "stories"` + `spec_folder = "<epic folder>"`, or per run with `bmad-loop run --spec <epic folder>` (which overrides the policy). Everything downstream — dev/verify/review/commit, worktree isolation, gates, crash resume, the TUI — is identical; only the story source and the per-story controls below differ.

**Per-story human checkpoints (stories mode).** Each `stories.yaml` entry carries two independent boolean flags:

- **`spec_checkpoint`** — pause _before_ code, to review the plan. The dev session halts right after planning (`Halt after planning.`) with the spec at `ready-for-dev`; the run pauses at a **plan checkpoint**. Approve to resume straight to implementation, or request a replan (resets the spec to `draft` so the next dispatch re-plans).
- **`done_checkpoint`** — pause _after_ the story commits, to review the result before the loop moves on (skipped automatically when it is the last story).

A story may set both (it pauses twice); `gates.mode` pauses stack on top. A blocked story escalates exactly as in sprint mode — `bmad-loop resolve`, then re-arm + resume — now with the story's title/description and the blocking condition surfaced; a pre-planning-halt **sentinel** spec is auto-deleted (a copy preserved under the run dir) on re-arm for a clean re-dispatch.

`bmad-loop run --dry-run --spec <folder>` prints the linear schedule (list order, checkpoint markers, live on-disk state); `bmad-loop status` shows the same stories board.

> Stories mode requires a `bmad-dev-auto` new enough to support folder+id dispatch; the run preflight (and `bmad-loop validate`) checks for it and tells you to update the BMAD module if it is missing. Sprint mode is unaffected and remains the default indefinitely.

## How a story flows

> This is sprint mode's flow. Stories mode swaps the story source (above) and adds the per-story plan/done checkpoints — the loop below is otherwise identical.

```text
sprint-status.yaml: 1-2-account-mgmt: ready-for-dev
  │
  ├─ DEV     tmux window: claude "/bmad-dev-auto 1-2-account-mgmt"
  │          bmad-dev-auto: plans a 1.5–4k-token spec, auto-approves it,
  │          implements, self-reviews inline (Blind + Edge-Case hunters),
  │          commits, finalizes spec → done … Stop hook signals the orchestrator
  ├─ VERIFY  spec exists · status done · baseline matches · diff non-empty
  │          · run [verify].commands (pytest, ruff…) — a broken build never
  │          reaches review; a failure spawns a fix session fed the output
  ├─ REVIEW  fresh window: claude "/bmad-dev-auto <done spec>" — re-invoking on a
  │  (gated) done spec runs a fresh independent step-04 review pass (Blind + Edge-Case
  │          hunters → triage → auto-apply patches → ledger → defer ambiguity →
  │          commit). Gated on the skill's `followup_review_recommended` flag
  │          (review.trigger = "recommended") or every story ("always"); bounded
  │          loop, default 3 cycles
  ├─ VERIFY  spec done · sprint done · run [verify].commands again — a failure
  │          routes a feedback-driven dev fix session, then a fresh review cycle
  └─ COMMIT  orchestrator squashes the iteration's commits into one story commit
             (then, under [scm] isolation = "worktree", merges the unit branch
             back into the target branch locally); epic boundary → gate / retro
```

**Failure handling:** bounded dev retries (verify-command failures keep the tree and feed the failing output to the next session via `--feedback`; other failures roll back to baseline), **plateau-defer** when review won't converge (story skipped, spec stashed into the run dir, `deferred-work.md` additions preserved, run continues), and typed escalations — `CRITICAL` pauses the run and notifies you (desktop + `ATTENTION` file), `PREFERENCE` is journaled and the run continues.

**Resolving a CRITICAL escalation:** the escalated story is parked in a terminal `escalated` phase — `resume` skips it. To un-stick it, run `bmad-loop resolve <run-id>` (or press `R` in the TUI). That opens an interactive **resolve agent** seeded with the escalation and the frozen spec; you converse with it to disambiguate the spec, it records the resolution, and on your confirmation the orchestrator re-arms the story (`escalated → pending`, spec status reset to `ready-for-dev`) and resumes — a clean rebuild against the corrected spec, then on through the rest of the sprint. Already fixed the spec yourself? `bmad-loop resolve <run-id> --no-interactive` skips straight to re-arm + resume.

## Deferred-work sweeps

Skills accumulate an append-only ledger (`deferred-work.md`, `DW-<n>` entries) of split-off goals, pre-existing review findings, and items deferred as "needs human decision". `bmad-loop sweep` processes it:

```text
bmad-loop sweep [--no-prompt] [--decisions-only] [--max-bundles N] [--repeat] [--max-cycles N] [--dry-run]
  │
  ├─ TRIAGE   fresh window: claude "/bmad-loop-sweep"
  │           verifies EVERY open entry against the actual code (ledger
  │           statuses are unreliable) and returns a machine-validated
  │           partition: already-resolved (orchestrator closes them, with
  │           evidence) · bundles (cohesive buildable groups) · blocked ·
  │           skip · decisions (frozen-block renegotiations, scope reversals)
  ├─ DECIDE   interactive runs walk you through each decision on the
  │           terminal (build / close / keep-open per option, with a
  │           recommendation); answers land in the ledger as `decision:`
  │           lines. Unattended runs skip this and leave decisions open.
  └─ BUNDLES  each bundle runs the normal pipeline: bmad-dev-auto (on the bundle
              spec, then re-invoked on the done spec for review) → verify commands
              → commit. The review gate also checks every bundle entry is
              `status: done` in the ledger.
```

**Answering missed decisions later.** An unattended sweep (`--no-prompt`) skips decisions, and an interactive one can be abandoned before you answer them all — those answers would otherwise be lost, since triage re-derives the decision set from the ledger every run. `bmad-loop decisions` (or press `d` in the TUI) surfaces every decision past sweeps left unanswered, reconstructed from their triage output, and lets you answer them out of band. A `close` is applied immediately; a `build`/`keep-open` is saved to `.bmad-loop/decisions.json` and consumed by the next sweep (build → bundle, keep-open → recorded) with no re-prompt. `--list` shows them without answering; `bmad-loop status` reports the outstanding count.

Sweeps are their own resumable runs (`bmad-loop resume <id>`). `[sweep] auto` in the policy fires an unattended sweep automatically at epic boundaries or run end; a failed/paused child sweep never interrupts the parent run.

Bundle dev sessions can themselves append new deferred entries (split-off goals, review findings). With `[sweep] repeat` (or `--repeat`) the sweep re-triages after each cycle and keeps going on that newly generated work, stopping when a cycle completes nothing addressable — nothing closed as already-resolved or by decision, no bundle done — or at `max_cycles`. Bundles that failed in an earlier cycle and entries a human chose to keep open are never re-bundled.

## Installing the skill module

The orchestrator drives the upstream `bmad-dev-auto` skill as its inner dev primitive — unmodified, so there is no fork to keep in sync; it both implements and (re-invoked on the done spec) runs the follow-up review — plus its own bundled `bmad-loop-*` skills for escalation, sweep, and setup. Your standard BMAD install is never modified. The three bundled skills ship in the `bmad-loop` wheel (canonical source: `src/bmad_loop/data/skills/`, BMAD module code `bmad-loop`) so `bmad-loop init` lays them down for you; `bmad-dev-auto` is a prerequisite installed by the BMad Method (bmm) module:

| Skill               | Role                                                                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bmad-dev-auto`     | unattended implementation + follow-up review (**upstream** — bmm prerequisite, not bundled) |
| `bmad-loop-resolve` | interactive CRITICAL-escalation resolution (`/bmad-loop-resolve <story>`)                   |
| `bmad-loop-sweep`   | deferred-work ledger triage (automation-only)                                               |
| `bmad-loop-setup`   | registers the module in `_bmad/` config + help                                              |

**Via uv + `bmad-loop init` (self-sufficient).** Installing the tool and running `init` is all you need — `init` installs the `bmad-loop-*` skills into `.claude/skills/` (claude) and/or `.agents/skills/` (codex/gemini) for the CLIs you select, alongside the hooks and policy:

```bash
# latest from main (tracks HEAD — newest features, less stable):
uv tool install "bmad-loop[tui] @ git+https://github.com/bmad-code-org/bmad-loop.git"

# OR a pinned release tag (reproducible — recommended for day-to-day use):
uv tool install "bmad-loop[tui] @ git+https://github.com/bmad-code-org/bmad-loop.git@v0.5.1"

bmad-loop init --project /path/to/project --cli claude   # add --cli codex/gemini as needed
claude "/bmad-loop-setup accept all defaults"            # registers _bmad/ config + help
```

The `[tui]` extra pulls in the dashboard/settings UI (textual); drop it for a headless install. `bmad-loop --version` confirms what you've got. Existing skill dirs are left untouched (`--force-skills` to overwrite a stale copy, `--no-skills` to manage skills yourself).

### Upgrading

**Easiest — let the setup skill do it.** Re-running `/bmad-loop-setup` (or `/bmad-loop-setup upgrade`) on an already-installed project performs the two-step ritual for you: it detects the existing install, upgrades the tool with `--reinstall`, re-lays the per-project skills with `--force-skills`, and re-stamps config — then reports the before → after version.

```bash
claude "/bmad-loop-setup upgrade"
```

**Manual — the two steps it runs.** Use these directly for non-Claude CLIs, CI, or scripting. Upgrading is two steps — the tool **and** the per-project skill copies, which `init` froze at install time and a tool upgrade does not touch:

```bash
# 1. upgrade the tool. --reinstall is required for a git source: a plain
#    `uv tool upgrade` reuses the cached commit and won't pull new code.
uv tool upgrade bmad-loop --reinstall                      # follows main or your pinned tag
#    to move to a newer tag, re-run install with the new ref:
#    uv tool install --force "bmad-loop[tui] @ git+https://github.com/bmad-code-org/bmad-loop.git@v0.5.1"

# 2. re-lay the refreshed skills into EACH project that uses bmad-loop:
bmad-loop init --project /path/to/project --force-skills
```

Your `.bmad-loop/policy.toml` is left untouched on upgrade — new keys are optional and fall back to their defaults, so configs survive. Check the [CHANGELOG / releases](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/bmad-loop/releases) for what changed between tags.

To remove bmad-loop from a project, see [Uninstalling](docs/setup-guide.md#uninstalling) — it reverses what `init` laid down (state, skills, hooks, gitignore) and uninstalls the tool.

**Via the BMAD-method installer.** The installer copies the bundled `bmad-loop-*` skills into your project (but not the orchestrator tool), alongside the upstream `bmad-dev-auto` skill the orchestrator drives. Finish setup with `/bmad-loop-setup`, which installs the tool from Git, asks which coding CLIs to drive, registers their hooks (`init` skips the already-present skills), and runs the preflight:

```bash
claude "/bmad-loop-setup accept all defaults"
```

See **[docs/setup-guide.md](docs/setup-guide.md)** for the full walkthrough — choosing CLIs, installing the tool and TUI together or separately, and initializing codex/gemini.

The bundled skills must be installed together with the upstream `bmad-dev-auto` dev session: `bmad-loop-sweep` owns the canonical `deferred-work-format.md` that the orchestrator normalizes the ledger to, and `bmad-dev-auto` appends the flat deferred-work entries it normalizes. The `bmad-dev-auto` skill is driven unmodified, so its own `customize.toml` applies as-is; it needs no merge — it is consumed directly from the bmm module. There is no review fork to keep in sync: review is just a re-invocation of `bmad-dev-auto` on the done spec.

## Policy (`.bmad-loop/policy.toml`)

`bmad-loop init` writes this template; running engines snapshot it at start, so edits apply to new runs and resumes (edit it live from the TUI with `g`).

```toml

**Gate modes:** `none` runs everything unattended; `per-epic` (default) pauses at epic boundaries; `per-story-spec-approval` pauses after each spec is written so you approve it before implementation is reviewed.

> In **stories mode** the `stories.yaml` list is flat — there are no epics — so the default `per-epic` gate never fires (nothing to bound). Use the per-story `spec_checkpoint` / `done_checkpoint` flags for HITL there, or `per-story-spec-approval` for a run-global spec gate. `none` and `per-story-spec-approval` behave the same as in sprint mode.

**Review:** `[review].enabled = false` drops the separate fresh-context review session; the dev pass instead runs `bmad-dev-auto`'s own internal two-layer review (Blind Hunter / Edge Case Hunter) and finalizes the story straight to `done` — one session per story instead of two, verify commands still gating the commit. Governs deferred-work sweeps too. When review is enabled, `[review].trigger` decides _when_ that separate pass runs: `recommended` (default) only when the `bmad-dev-auto` session flags `followup_review_recommended` — it already triple-reviews inline and recommends an independent pass only when its changes were significant; `always` runs it every story. The follow-up loop is bounded by `limits.max_review_cycles` (default 3), which caps oscillation.

`bmad-loop init` (without `--cli`) registers hooks for every CLI profile the policy references, so a dual-client setup needs no extra flags.

### Worktree isolation

By default work happens **in place** on the checked-out branch (`[scm] isolation = "none"` — byte-for-byte the prior behavior). Set `isolation = "worktree"` and each story (and each sweep bundle) runs in its own `git worktree` on a dedicated `bmad_loop/<run_id>[/<story>]` branch cut from the target branch, then merges back into the target **locally** (`merge_strategy` = `ff` / `merge` / `squash`). The main checkout stays free while a run is in flight, and run state never moves into a worktree — `.bmad-loop/` always lives in the main repo.

- **`branch_per`** — `story` (a branch per story) or `run` (one shared branch across the run; this forces `delete_branch = false` so the shared branch survives between units).
- **`target_branch`** — the branch every unit merges into; empty means the branch checked out at run start. A configured branch is created if missing (a detached HEAD or unborn repo pauses the run rather than merging onto an unreferenced commit).
- **`keep_failed`** (default on) — a deferred/escalated unit's worktree + branch stay mounted for inspection, and its full diff (tracked + untracked) is preserved to `run_dir/failed/<unit>/changes.patch`. `failed_diff_max_mb` caps the per-file size of untracked files in that patch (oversized files skipped with a marker); `failed_diff_unlimited` lifts the cap.
- **`commit_message_template`** — when set, the message used for story/bundle commits (`{story_key}` / `{run_id}` substituted).
- **`seed_adapter_defaults`** (default on) / **`worktree_seed`** — a worktree checks out _tracked_ files only, so a project's gitignored MCP/CLI configs (`.mcp.json`, `.claude/settings.json`, `.codex/config.toml`, `.gemini/settings.json`) are absent from a fresh worktree — without them an isolated session can't reach its MCP server and stalls on readiness. With `seed_adapter_defaults` on, each loaded adapter's own configs are copied in from the main repo before the session launches (the defaults live in each CLI profile's `seed_files`); `worktree_seed` adds extra project-relative paths on top. Seeding is copy-when-absent and runs before the signal-hook merge, so a seeded `settings.json` keeps its real content and just gains the Stop hook — and the seeded paths are shielded from the unit's `git add -A`.

Merge-back is always **serialized** — `max_parallel` is a validated knob clamped to `1` until parallel fan-out lands. PRs aren't created automatically; open them by hand from the unit branches afterward if you want them.

</p>

For a monorepo or any layout where the git root differs from the project dir, set an optional `repo_root` key in `_bmad/bmm/config.yaml` — it decouples where git/code work happens from where run state lives (defaults to the project dir).

### Plugins

The orchestrator is extensible through a **plugin system** — a general layer that adapts the run/sweep cycle without touching the core loop. A plugin is a folder-drop `plugin.toml` manifest (metadata, declarative `[hooks.<stage>]` shell commands, a `[[settings]]` schema, and an optional in-process `[python]` module), bundled under `bmad_loop/data/plugins/<name>/` and overridable per project at `.bmad-loop/plugins/<name>/`. At every run/sweep lifecycle stage a plugin can **observe, veto** (defer / pause / skip), and **mutate** a shared context; a zero-plugin run pays nothing (O(1) no-op fast path) and stays byte-identical to before.

Two trust tiers: a **data-only / declarative** plugin (settings + shell hooks) takes effect as soon as its folder is discovered, while a plugin that ships an in-process `[python]` module is **never imported unless its name is listed in `[plugins] enabled`** in `.bmad-loop/policy.toml` — dropping a folder in never runs code. Every hook is failure-isolated: a raise is caught, journalled, and disables that instance for the rest of the run rather than crashing it. A plugin's `[[settings]]` render in the TUI settings editor and persist under `[plugins.<name>]`.

```toml
[plugins]
enabled = ["unity"]        # only these plugins' [python] modules load
```

See **[Writing a bmad-loop plugin](docs/plugin-authoring-guide.md)** for the manifest, hook, stage, settings, trust, and workflow reference; a complete worked example ships under [`examples/plugins/guardrails/`](examples/plugins/guardrails/).

### Game-engine projects (Unity)

A niche game-engine layer — built **on the plugin system** — for projects whose dev/sweep cycle needs the agent to drive a **live engine Editor** — e.g. a Unity project the agent manipulates through an Editor MCP ([IvanMurzak/Unity-MCP](https://github.com/IvanMurzak/Unity-MCP) or [CoplayDev/unity-mcp](https://github.com/CoplayDev/unity-mcp)). It's off by default; normal projects never list it in `[plugins] enabled` and nothing changes. Unity ships bundled at `bmad_loop/data/plugins/unity/`, overridable per project under `.bmad-loop/plugins/unity/`.

The core constraint: a live Editor MCP can only act on the folder its Editor has open, and Unity binds one Editor per folder and can't be repointed live. So `editor_mode` is coupled to `[scm] isolation`:

- **`shared`** (default; requires `isolation = "none"`) — the agent works **in place** on the project your warm Editor already has open. Zero relaunches, full live MCP, the Editor stays open across stories. Before each unit runs, a **readiness gate** blocks until the Editor + MCP report ready (so a session never starts against a half-open Editor); if it never comes up the unit is deferred with an `ATTENTION` notice instead of failing mid-session.
- **`per_worktree`** (requires `isolation = "worktree"`) — one **managed Editor per worktree**, run serially. For each unit a setup hook makes the fresh worktree a usable Unity project (launches its own Editor on the worktree path, writes the worktree's `.mcp.json`, primes the worktree's `Library` with a reflink/CoW copy of the warm main `Library` so the import is incremental, not a crash-prone cold reimport), the readiness gate waits for it, the agent drives it, then a teardown hook quits that Editor — on completion **and** on pause/escalation, so it never outlives its worktree. The MCP server's generated skill tree is gitignored (absent from a fresh checkout), so the plugin seeds it into each worktree via `seed_globs`. If setup fails the unit is deferred rather than run against no Editor.

Enable shared mode (the recommended Unity workflow) in `.bmad-loop/policy.toml`:

```toml
[plugins]
enabled = ["unity"]

[plugins.unity]
editor_mode = "shared"     # requires [scm] isolation = "none" (the default)
mcp = "ivanmurzak"         # ivanmurzak | coplaydev
unity_path = ""            # explicit Editor binary for per_worktree; "" = auto-detect
ready_timeout_sec = 600
ready_grace_sec = -1       # delay before the first readiness probe; -1 = auto
```

All five `[plugins.unity]` keys are editable in the TUI settings editor (`g`) under the
Unity plugin's section (shown once `unity` is in `[plugins] enabled`). To run a project on
a different engine — or reshape the Unity plugin — see **[Writing a Game Engine
plugin](docs/game-engine-plugin-guide.md)** (manifest schema, lifecycle hooks, a minimal
Godot example) and **[Writing a plugin for a specific Editor MCP](docs/game-engine-mcp-guide.md)**
(IvanMurzak vs CoplayDev, readiness probing, per-worktree isolation, and the full
`BMAD_LOOP_UNITY_*` env-var reference). The legacy `[engine]` block still loads — it's
folded onto `[plugins.unity]` with a deprecation warning — but will be removed in a future
release; migrate to `[plugins] enabled = ["unity"]`.

The readiness gate runs the plugin's `ready_cmd` (`unity_ready.py`), which for `ivanmurzak` shells out to the Unity-MCP CLI's `wait-for-ready` (with an explicit `--timeout`, since the CLI's own default is only 120s) and for `coplaydev` does a connectivity check against the MCP server. It first waits `ready_grace_sec` for the Editor to start before probing — `-1` (the default) auto-picks **120s for a cold `per_worktree` Editor** and **0s for a warm `shared` one** — then retries so a fast connection-refused against a not-yet-listening Editor doesn't abort the gate; the grace counts against `ready_timeout_sec`. The exact CLI name/subcommand and endpoint move between MCP releases — verify against your installed version and override `ready_cmd` (or the whole plugin) under `.bmad-loop/plugins/unity/` if they differ.

For `per_worktree`, set `editor_mode = "per_worktree"` with `[scm] isolation = "worktree"`. The bundled Unity plugin wires the worktree-Editor lifecycle against the **IvanMurzak** CLI (`open` / `setup-mcp` / `close`, which key off the project path with auto port detection — verified against v0.81.1). A fresh worktree has no `Library` (it's gitignored), and opening Unity on an empty `Library` forces a cold full reimport that crashes the import workers on a real project — so the setup hook **primes** the worktree's `Library` with a reflink/CoW copy of your warm main `Library` (`<repo>/Library`), near-instant on btrfs/xfs, making the import incremental; it falls back to a deep copy, then to a symlinked empty cache under the gitignored `.bmad-loop/cache/`, off-CoW or when no warm `Library` exists. Tune this with `BMAD_LOOP_UNITY_LIBRARY_SEED` / `…_SEED_MODE` (and `BMAD_LOOP_UNITY_LIBRARY_CACHE` for the fallback cache root — see the [Game Engine MCP guide](docs/game-engine-mcp-guide.md) for the full env reference); a [Unity Accelerator](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityAccelerator.html) helps further, and `unity_path` pins the Editor binary. A cold worktree Editor takes time to launch and import — bump `ready_grace_sec`/`ready_timeout_sec` if your project's first import runs long. CoplayDev's single shared-server model isn't wired for a managed per-worktree launch — point `worktree_setup_cmd`/`worktree_teardown_cmd` at your own scripts under `.bmad-loop/plugins/unity/`, or use shared mode.

## Run state

Everything about a run lives in `.bmad-loop/runs/<run-id>/` (gitignored): `state.json` (resumable engine state), `journal.jsonl` (every decision), `events/` (hook signals), `tasks/<id>/` (per-session prompt + result + escalations), `logs/` (raw pane output, debugging only), `deferred/` (stashed specs from deferred stories), `resolve/<story>/` (escalation `context.json` + the resolve agent's `resolution.json`), `ATTENTION` (human-readable alerts).

Token usage is read from each CLI's local session transcript (selected by the profile's `usage_parser`) and aggregated per story (`bmad-loop status`).

Each run drives its agents inside a dedicated tmux session, `bmad-loop-<run-id>`. It is torn down automatically when the run finishes (disable with `[adapter] cleanup_session_on_finish = false` to inspect agent windows afterwards), and `stop` always kills it. A paused or interrupted run keeps its session for `resume`, which clears any stale session and spins up a fresh one. Sessions left behind by older runs — or by a `cleanup_session_on_finish = false` policy — can be swept any time with `bmad-loop cleanup` (or `c` in the TUI).

## Other coding CLIs

One generic driver (`adapters/generic.py`) runs any coding CLI that fits the injection + hook-signal transport; everything CLI-specific lives in a declarative **profile** (`adapters/profile.py`), and the terminal transport itself sits behind a pluggable `TerminalMultiplexer` seam (tmux is the only backend today). Built-in profiles ship as TOML in `bmad_loop/data/profiles/`:

| Profile       | Status                        | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| `codex`       | supported, E2E-verified       | Codex ≥ 0.139. No slash expansion in the initial prompt — the profile renders `$skill-name` mentions (plus a "use subagents as needed" nudge) instead. No SessionEnd hook; window-death fallback covers crashes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `gemini`      | supported, E2E-verified       | Gemini CLI ≥ 0.46 (hooks on by default since then). Launches with `-i` to stay interactive; `AfterAgent` maps to canonical Stop. Usage parser validated against real chat logs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `copilot`     | supported, E2E-verified       | GitHub Copilot **CLI** (the `copilot` binary, GA ≥ 2026-02) — _not_ the VS Code extension. Launches with `-i` to stay interactive; turn-end is `agentStop` (per response turn); `--allow-all-tools` for unattended runs. `copilot-events` usage parser reads token totals from the trailing `session.shutdown` line, so the profile waits a short grace (`usage_grace_s = 8`) before tallying. **Pin a capable model** (see below). |
| `antigravity` | experimental — probe-required | Google **Antigravity CLI** (`agy` ≥ 1.0.16). Launches with `-i` to stay interactive; `Stop` is the turn-end event (agy has no SessionStart/SessionEnd hook). Skills and hooks live in `.agents/` (flat `Stop` handler in `.agents/hooks.json`). `usage_parser = "none"` until a token parser is written. Verify against your build with `probe-adapter antigravity`.                                                                |

**Copilot — pin a capable model:** Copilot's free default (GPT-5 mini) is unreliable for the multi-step dev/review skills — it silently skips steps mid-workflow and fails the story. Set a capable model in policy, e.g. `[adapter] model = "claude-sonnet-4-6"` (passed through as `--model`), for end-to-end reliability. Because Copilot fires `agentStop` per response turn, a thorough multi-turn review needs more than one nudge to finish; the profile ships `stop_without_result_nudges = 5`, and you can tune it per stage (e.g. `[adapter.review] stop_without_result_nudges = …`). Both knobs are editable in the settings TUI under `[adapter]`.

**On budgets:** agentic sessions are dominated by cache reads (80–90%+ of raw tokens), which every supported vendor bills at ~0.1x base input. The `max_tokens_per_story` check therefore uses a cost-weighted total — cache reads count at `limits.cache_read_weight` (default 0.1) — while displayed totals stay raw. Set the weight to 1.0 to budget raw tokens.

**Shared prerequisites:** the `bmad-loop-*` skills must be present in `.agents/skills/` (codex and gemini read it; Claude Code reads `.claude/skills/`), and each CLI must have been run once interactively in the project for auth/trust — `bmad-loop init --cli codex --cli gemini` installs the skills into `.agents/skills/`, registers the hook relay, and prints the per-CLI first-run steps.

**Adding a CLI without touching Python:** drop a TOML file in `<project>/.bmad-loop/profiles/<name>.toml` with at minimum a binary, `prompt_template`, bypass flags, and a `[hooks]` block picking one of the config dialects (`claude-settings-json` / `codex-hooks-json` / `gemini-settings-json` / `copilot-settings-json` / `antigravity-hooks-json`) plus a native→canonical event map. The full profile schema — every `CLIProfile` / `HookSpec` field and its default — lives in the **[Profile field reference](docs/adapter-authoring-guide.md#profile-field-reference)** of the adapter authoring guide, the single canonical home for it. The hook relay script and orchestrator are CLI-agnostic — each registration passes the canonical event name as the script argument. A CLI whose hook config clones one of the existing dialects (the ecosystem trend) needs nothing else; a genuinely different transport gets its own adapter class instead (see [Writing a new adapter class](docs/adapter-authoring-guide.md#writing-a-new-adapter-class) and the opencode HTTP+SSE design stub in `adapters/opencode_http.py`).

**Finalizing a profile:** the facts a profile needs that live in no doc — the CLI's exact hook payload shape, its transcript location/format, and the token schema a `usage_parser` reads — are collected and sanitized by `bmad-loop probe-adapter <cli>` (a zero-launch scan by default, or `--probe` for a live capture). The [adapter authoring guide](docs/adapter-authoring-guide.md) walks through using it end to end.

Cursor CLI is currently blocked on two gaps, for whoever picks it up: token usage is not exposed anywhere (hooks, JSON output, or on-disk chats), and slash-command expansion of the initial prompt argument is unverified — its `sessionStart`/`stop` hooks do fire in the CLI, so a profile using the window-death fallback plus `usage_parser = "none"` is feasible.

## Development

```bash
uv sync --all-extras             # adds pytest, ruff, pytest-asyncio (+ the [tui] extra)
uv run pytest -q                 # unit + engine scenarios (mock adapter) + tmux integration
uv run ruff check src tests scripts
```

**Regenerating the screenshots** in this README: they're rendered headlessly from a populated mock project (no live engine needed) — see [`scripts/gen_screenshots.py`](scripts/gen_screenshots.py).

```bash
uv sync --extra tui
uv run python scripts/gen_screenshots.py   # writes docs/images/*.svg + *.png (PNG needs `resvg` on PATH)
uv run python scripts/gen_demo.py          # writes docs/images/demo.gif  (needs `resvg` + `ffmpeg`)
```

The hero **demo GIF** (`docs/images/demo.gif`) is generated the same headless way — `gen_demo.py` drives the read-only TUI through a scripted walkthrough and stitches the frames with `ffmpeg`. ([`scripts/record-demo.sh`](scripts/record-demo.sh) is an alternative that records a _real_ live run via VHS or asciinema, if you'd rather show actual agent sessions.)
