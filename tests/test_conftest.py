"""Contract tests for the shared fixtures and host-capability gates in
`tests/conftest.py`.

`project` hands every test a copytree clone of a session-scoped template repo, so
the template's shape is a shared dependency of most of the suite. What is pinned
here is the part of that shape other modules rely on without asserting it.

The gates need the same treatment for a sharper reason: `opencode_runs` decides
whether an entire `*_live.py` module runs or skips, and nothing downstream can
notice when it answers wrongly — a gate that wrongly says "absent" reports a
tidy skip, not a failure. Its call shape and each of its three refusals are
therefore pinned here, one fact per row.

    `git commit` normally ends by spawning `git maintenance run --auto --quiet

    `project` copytrees for every test. `objects/maintenance.lock` gets listed by
    scandir, unlinked by that child, then opened by copy2 and is already gone, so
    one arbitrary unrelated test dies at fixture setup on `[Errno 2]`. It reddens a
    different test each time and only on whichever interpreter leg loses the race,
    which is the flake signature this suite treats as a bug.

    Graded on the behavior, not on the config key: reading back
    `maintenance.auto` would pass on a git that had stopped honouring it. This
