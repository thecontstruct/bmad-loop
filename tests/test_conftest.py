"""Contract tests for the shared fixtures and host-capability gates in
`tests/conftest.py`.

`project` hands every test a copytree clone of a session-scoped template repo, so
the template's shape is a shared dependency of most of the suite. What is pinned
here is the part of that shape other modules rely on without asserting it.

The gates need the same treatment for a sharper reason: `opencode_runs` decides
whether an entire `*_live.py` module runs or skips, and nothing downstream can
notice when it answers wrongly — a gate that wrongly says "absent" reports a
tidy skip, not a failure. Its call shape and each of its three refusals are
therefore pinned here, one fact per row.

    arbitrary arithmetic and local dataflow, which this focused scan will not do; the

    Sites are keyed by the assignment's FIRST `Name` target, since the property belongs to
    the fake-CLI constant rather than to a test def — so a chained `OTHER =
    DETACHED_WRITER_FAKE_CLI = ...` keys the site under `OTHER` and makes the inventory
    fire on a file that is in fact correct. The derived `PUBLICATION_FAULT_FAKE_CLI`
    inherits the gate through a `str.replace` and holds no fragment of its own, so it is
    deliberately not a site here; the rendered-text asserts in `tests/test_stories_e2e.py`
    are what cover that inheritance.

    Accepts exactly ``int(<conftest alias of REAL_MUX_HANG_CEILING_S>)`` immediately after
    the fragment, under either import form via `_conftest_aliases` — the `int()` is load
    bearing, because bash arithmetic cannot take the `90.0` float. Everything else offends,
    including a plain (non-f-string) constant that carries the fragment: that is the
    hardcoded-90 case this guard exists for, and it counts as a site AND an offender.

    Like `_scan_reap_deadlines` this does not flag an assignment holding zero sites — most
    module constants have no ceiling at all. `_detach_ceiling_inventory_offenders` is what
    keeps a scan that found nothing from passing vacuously.

    KNOWN BLIND SPOTS, deliberately not closed — the shape above is matched literally, so
    every one of these scans CLEAN and would carry a hardcoded budget past the guard:

    * a name-built spelling (`f"{key}={int(...)}"`), the fragment never being a literal;
    * a ceiling assembled outside a module-level assignment — a helper call, or a dict
      entry consumed later;
    * `tree.body` is iterated directly, so an assignment nested in a module-level `if`,
      `try` or `with` is never reached;
    * an `AugAssign` append (`FAKE += "detach_ack_ceiling_s=90\\n"`) is not an `Assign`
      and so is not inspected;
    * a SECOND fragment occurring EARLIER in the same f-string part — only the part's
      tail is graded, and the site still counts 1, so the earlier one is invisible;
    * a `conversion` or `format_spec` on the formatted value is accepted, since only the
      wrapped expression is graded (`{int(CEILING)!r}` and `{int(CEILING):d}` both pass);
    * a module-level REBINDING of the imported ceiling name is unseen — `_conftest_aliases`
      resolves the import, not the current binding. `_scan_reap_deadlines` shares this
      limit exactly, and diverging here would split the two scanners' alias doctrine;
    * scope is `tests/test_stories_e2e.py` alone, so the same fragment hardcoded in any
      other module is out of scope entirely.

    KNOWN FALSE POSITIVE, accepted for the same reason: the fragment must END an f-string
    part IMMEDIATELY before a `FormattedValue`, so a legitimate quoted spelling
    (`f'detach_ack_ceiling_s="{int(REAL_MUX_HANG_CEILING_S)}"'`) is reported as an offender
    even though it splices the shared ceiling correctly. Write the bare shape and the
    guard sees it.

    Closing any of the above means resolving arbitrary dataflow or widening past the shape
    the spec fixes; the narrow shape is the point, and probe rows below pin the limits that
    matter so they stay recorded limits rather than surprises.

# comment explaining it as `16 + 3 + 28`; an E2E renamed into a harness name cancels
# against the harness count, so the total holds, every row stays green, and the comment
# quietly becomes false. What the buckets below buy is precise about which parts: the
# NAMED prefixes (`test_tmux_`, `test_e2e_`, `test_reap_e2e_`) are graded as families, so
# a def leaving or joining one of them is named. `_OTHER_DEFS` is a RESIDUAL, not a
# family — any 28 gated defs no named prefix claims satisfy it — so what the pair of
# buckets really pins is the BOUNDARY between the E2E families and the remainder, which
# is the edge the rotted `16 + 3 + 28` could cross undetected. Changes wholly inside the
# residual still cancel, and deliberately so: the prose being enforced named three
# families, the third being "everything else", and subdividing further would assert a
# breakdown that prose never made.

# The attribution RULE `_bucket_for` implements and the rows below grade:
#   * a def is attributed to the LONGEST declared prefix matching its name, so dict ORDER
#     is never load-bearing. No two prefixes NEST today (`test_reap_e2e_x` does not start
#     with `test_e2e_`, so every rule agrees on it); longest-match matters the moment a
#     nested pair like `{"a_": 1, "a_b_": 1}` is declared, where `a_b_x` must read as an
#     `a_b_`, and `test_e2e_def_count_inventory_attributes_to_the_longest_declared_prefix`
#     pins exactly that shape;
#   * a def no declared prefix claims falls to the module's `_OTHER_DEFS` bucket WHEN the
#     module declares one;
#   * a module declaring NO `_OTHER_DEFS` bucket refuses an unexplained def BY NAME rather
#     than absorbing it into a count.
