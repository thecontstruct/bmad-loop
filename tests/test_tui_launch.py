"""tui.launch builds exact tmux/CLI argv — verified against monkeypatched
subprocess so no real tmux server is touched, plus one real-subprocess
sanity check of the captured path.

The tmux invocations now live in the multiplexer backend (launch drives the
seam), so the tmux subprocess/which seams are patched on ``tmux_base`` (the
shared backend base where the spawn primitive lives); the captured read-only
path still shells out from ``launch`` itself."""
