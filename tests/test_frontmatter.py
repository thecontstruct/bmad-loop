"""`frontmatter.set_frontmatter_status` — the verified in-place status writer.

Four sections. The CHARACTERIZATION half was written
against the pre-rewrite line scanner and is green on both sides of it: it pins
the formatting-preserving minimal edit, and the one surviving deliberate
non-preservation (a quoted value is written back unquoted) that a "make it a YAML
round-trip" refactor would silently change out from under callers three files
away. LINE ENDINGS pins #357 part 1: the same contract, over the bytes the old
`read_text`/`write_text` pair relaid across the whole file. INLINE COMMENTS pins
#357 part 2, where the gating is inverted — `_verified` cannot see a fabricated
comment, so a regex is the gate and the oracle is only the backstop. The BEHAVIOR
half pins the rewrite: a writer that verifies its own edit by re-parsing, and
RAISES rather than returning a `False` nobody reads when the reader can see a
status it cannot safely move.

#
# The half of "only the status value changes" the writer used to break on every
# call (#357). `read_text`/`write_text` relaid EVERY ending in the file — a CRLF
# spec came back all-LF on POSIX and an all-LF spec came back all-CRLF on
# Windows — so these were unwritable before the byte-level read/write. Two gates
# per case, because either alone passes for the wrong reason: byte-exact equality
# (which a substring assertion cannot give) AND "no bare LF was introduced", the
# one that catches `_replace_value` re-emitting a flat `"\n"` for the single line
# it touched and leaving the file mixed.
#
# WHICH PLATFORM PROVES WHAT. These three cover the READ half; reverting it to
# `read_text` fails all three anywhere. The WRITE half is POSIX-invisible —
# `write_text`'s `newline=None` translates `"\n"` to `os.linesep`, which on POSIX
# is `"\n"` — so reverting `write_bytes` keeps this whole file green on Linux and
# only the Windows CI leg catches it. What catches it there is the byte-exact
# equality in the CHARACTERIZATION half above: those fixtures are all-LF, and
# `write_text` on Windows returns them all-CRLF. That is why those assertions are
# bare comparisons rather than routed through an os.linesep-modelling helper —
# the helper that used to sit here described the defect instead of failing on it.
