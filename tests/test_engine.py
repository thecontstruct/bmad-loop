    builds rather than handing the pre-pause engine's object back (DW-241), the
    `tests/test_sweep.py` row of the same name carried over to this file's helper.

    `cli.cmd_resume` constructs `Journal(run_dir)` and passes it to
    `runsetup.compose_resume`; a fresh `Journal` starts with `_log_task = None`.
    Sharing one object carried the PRE-PAUSE session's `set_active_log` binding across
    the resume boundary, and `Journal.append` stamps `log_task`/`log_pos` onto every
    entry while that binding is set — so every row a resumed engine writes BEFORE
    starting its own session (a replay pre-pass, a resume-carry, a cycle row) was
    stamped with a log from the run before the pause. A real resume writes those rows
    bare. `Journal` holds NO in-memory record list — `append` writes one line to
    `run_dir/journal.jsonl` and `entries()` re-reads it — so the binding is the only
    state a shared object could leak; every "exactly once" claim in this file's
    resume rows was already round-tripping through disk.

    Graded on the CONSEQUENCE, never on object identity: `resumed.journal is not
    engine.journal` would be tautological and would red for a refactor that changed
    nothing observable.

    `adapters/generic.py _read_result` rejects a non-dict top level, so the

    The document is refused through the existing empty-document channel: no new

    its `session-start` is still paired with a `session-end`, and the persisted
    snapshot is `{}` — not `None`, which would claim the session recorded no
    payload at all.

    The `[["a", 1]]` row is the reason this is parametrized rather than a single

    Each of those rows stops at the tuple's spelling. What none of them grades is
    the JOIN `_verify_dev_artifacts` makes: it feeds that tuple to
    `verify.verify_dev` as `engine_written`, and only running git with it proves
    the pathspec resolves onto THIS attempt's nested ledger rather than onto the
    outer project's. The verify-side monorepo cluster pairs every value row with an
    outcome row and says so in prose; the engine-side producer had no such pair.

    Built from the ENGINE side on purpose: the tuple driven through the gate is the
    one `_harvest_gate_exclude` really returns, so an edit to the producer's root or
    to the consumer's handling of `engine_written` reddens this row. It does NOT
    grade the production WIRING — it calls `verify.verify_dev` directly rather than
    through `_verify_dev_artifacts`, so deleting
    `engine_written=self._harvest_gate_exclude(task)` from that caller leaves this
    row and its three siblings green. That wiring is covered separately, by
    `test_nonfixable_retry_reverts_harvest_before_the_next_attempt`. Its mirror,
    `tests/test_verify.py::test_verify_dev_refuses_a_bare_spec_flip_under_the_monorepo_shape`,
    grades the consumer's own exclusions; this one grades the tuple the engine hands it.

    Every seeded file is COMMITTED because `verify._changes_since` counts untracked
    files as residue: an untracked decoy, ledger or board would register as the work
    this attempt never did, and the refusal would then hold for a reason that has
    nothing to do with the pathspec's root. Committing also forces git's
    exclude-pathspec branch, which is the branch this row exists to grade.

    The decoy is created and then left ALONE. It exists to make "the wrong spelling
    names a REAL file" true by value; had the attempt also touched it, the correct
    spelling would count it as work and the gate could not refuse at all.

    The gate outcome is asserted BEFORE the prefix equality deliberately. The
    sibling value row above already grades the spelling, so under the ablation this
    row has to redden on the OUTCOME to be worth its place — an equality assertion
    reached first would make it a second copy of that row.

    Ablation: set `root = paths.project` inside `_harvest_gate_exclude` and this
    reddens with `ok=True` — the un-prefixed spelling excludes the untouched outer
    decoy instead, this attempt's nested ledger append then counts as the work it
    never did, and the proof-of-work gate passes.

    Asserts the SPECIFIC reason, for the reason its verify-side mirror gives:

    `tests/test_verify.py::test_verify_dev_park_zero_diff_excludes_the_orchestrators_own_writes`
    (DW-132), hand-spells `engine_written=("ledger.md",)`, so the producer is never
    invoked there and re-rooting it leaves that row green.

    Driven through `Engine._verify_dev_artifacts` rather than `verify.verify_dev`
    directly — unlike its gate-arm sibling above — because for this arm that method
    IS the join: it is where `engine_written=self._harvest_gate_exclude(task)` meets
    `operator_park=self._operator_park_enabled()`, and the tuple graded here has to
    be the one the producer really returns rather than one the row spelled itself.

    The nested shape is what makes the producer's root separable, for the reason the
    sibling states: a `project`-rooted spelling names the OUTER project's REAL ledger
    once git resolves it in the code tree, instead of collapsing to a pathspec that
    matches nothing and agreeing with the correct spelling by accident.

    Every seeded file is COMMITTED, for two reasons that land on different files.
    `verify._changes_since` filters untracked paths through the same exclusions the
    probe applies, so the board, the spec and the nested ledger are unaffected by
    their tracked state — the outer DECOY is the only file untracked residue could
    come from, and `park_zero_diff` would then be `False` for a reason with nothing to
    do with the pathspec's root. Committing the ledger and the board is what makes the
    harvested append a TRACKED diff, which forces git's exclude-pathspec branch — the
    branch this row exists to grade, and the sibling's stated reason for committing.

    The decoy is created and then left ALONE. It exists to make "the wrong spelling
    names a REAL file" true by value; had the attempt also touched it, the CORRECT
    spelling would count it as residue and the observation could never be `True`.

    The outcome is asserted BEFORE the prefix pin, deliberately and for the sibling's
    reason: under the ablation this row must redden on the OBSERVATION rather than on
    a spelling equality the value rows above already grade.

    Ablation, measured: set `root = paths.project` inside `_harvest_gate_exclude` and
    this reddens on `park_zero_diff is False` — the un-prefixed spelling excludes the
    untouched outer decoy instead, so the orchestrator's own append to the NESTED
    ledger is counted and an accepted park is recorded as having left residue it never
    left. The DW-121 gate-arm row above reddens with it.

    the record loses the only committed route back to the spec.

    for an entry of its own — `next_seq` reads the shortened text. Keyed by id

    reports nothing moved: a silent loss of exactly what this repair exists to
    preserve, with a journal line saying it did nothing wrong.

    Re-appending is not the answer either — that publishes a duplicate id, which
    the writer's own `next_seq` and the sweep's duplicate-id refusal both treat as
    corruption. So the pair is reported and left alone, the same call the flat

    being empty — an untracked ledger reaches the baseline probe, spawning git
    and then taking the ledger lock for a restore with nothing to restore.

    That probe count is the oracle, and deliberately, because the DATA oracles
    below no longer grade this gate at all. Since #735 the write arm is
    `anchored and current == expected`, and an untracked ledger has no blob at
    the baseline, so `expected` is None and the arm cannot fire whether the gate
    runs or not: control falls through to the append-only merge, which finds
    nothing the snapshot has and disk has lost, and writes nothing. Deleting the
    gate used to clobber DW-2 — the consequence this docstring claimed — and now

    record DW-197 changed, and which no row pinned in either direction.

    Before it, the child's own top-of-cycle `read_for_write` raised, `_run_inner`'s
    nested arm re-raised, and the raise landed in `_maybe_auto_sweep`'s
    `except (Exception, SystemExit)` arm: the parent recorded `SWEEP_REFUSED_FAILED`,
    journaled `sweep-auto-failed` and notified. The child now STOPS instead, so the
    factory returns plainly and the parent takes the `else` arm — trigger spent,
    `sweep-auto-finished`, no refusal and no notification.

    That is the truthful record, which is why the row asserts it rather than trying
    to restore the old one: the child finalized its run dir and reported its own stop, with its own
    repair notice naming the ledger. Repair is followed by a fresh sweep. The cost, named in
    `docs/FEATURES.md` beside the other auto-sweep residuals, is that the PARENT's
    journal no longer says anything about the ledger — the stop token lives in the
    child's run dir. This row is where that trade is written down.

    The child is driven through the real `sweep_factory` seam with a real
    `SweepEngine`, because a factory that merely returned would be
    indistinguishable from `..._latches_a_factory_that_never_signalled` above and
    would grade nothing about DW-197. The fault is armed INSIDE the factory and
    undone as it returns, so the parent's own run never meets it.

    Ablation: restore the raise at `_loop`'s read (narrow `_read_cycle_ledger` to
    `except deferredwork.LedgerReadError` alone). The parent goes back to recording
    a failed child — `sweeps_refused == {"run-end": "failed"}`, `sweep-auto-failed`
    journaled and `sweep-auto-finished` gone, all three verified under the mutation
    — but the row reds first on the absent child journal. The real nested lifecycle

    other, and the "never interrupts this run" contract has to cover it. It is a
    `BaseException`, so a guard written over `Exception` missed it here, in every
    arm of `_run_inner`, and in `cli.main`: it unwound to process exit 1 with the
    parent left neither `finished` nor `crashed`, no `run-complete`, and an
    orphaned agent session.

    Not a hypothetical shape — `runsetup.make_adapters` raises exactly this for
    an unresolvable profile, an unknown/unloadable adapter kind, a failed adapter
    construction, an adapter class that rejects a bootstrap keyword, and an
    unusable multiplexer; that last gate re-probes live (`mux_usable` bottoms out
    in a bare `shutil.which`) on every call, so a child sweep can hit it in a
    parent run that launched fine.

    Every one of those six sites is inside `compose_sweep`, ahead of the
    `on_started` boundary, so this models the raise WITHOUT signalling and the
    record is `sweep-auto-not-started`: no child run dir survives an adapter build
    that exits.

# raise sites: an `"aborted"` result handed back by the adapter's in-session poll
# (site A), and a hard file still on disk once a session has been recorded and
# saved (site B, the `_post_kill_reconcile`-rescued case). All three take the HARD
# arm: unconditional teardown, `run-stop` carrying `via="stop-request"` and no
# `graceful` flag. These tests lodge the control file directly, exactly as the
# graceful ones do.
#
# A nested auto-sweep child reads a second channel: the OWNING run's dir, published
# by the outermost `run()` and polled by the adapter and by site B's owner leg. That
# leg never consumes — the file belongs to the parent, whose own hard arm has to

    `reset --hard` returning and the restore's observation read is not
    reset-owned, and the snapshot must not be republished over it.

    The anchor this replaces was `current == observed and gits`, with `observed`
    read once the rollback returned. A rival landing inside that window BECOMES
    `observed`, so the comparison holds later and labels the rival's bytes "what
    reset put back". The blob anchor is taken from `task.baseline_commit`
    instead, which no rival can author.

    The oracle is the rival's SURVIVAL and the journal kind, never the restored
    bytes: this ledger is tracked, so `reset --hard` republishes its committed
    text whether or not this code runs at all, and a byte assertion would pass
    for the wrong reason (proven by control in #726 session 6).

    PRIOR park's text, read out of the repo — to a path of the planter's choosing.
    A driven session writes under this root all run long, which is what makes the
    directory swap a real move rather than a hypothetical one.

    The redirect is planted BY THE PRE-COMMIT HOOK, which is the only honest place
    for it: `_write_park_record` has already captured the prior and rewritten the
    record by then, so planting earlier would refuse that write instead and this
    row would grade a different site. The hook fires in exactly the window between
    the record write and the rollback, and it moves the real directory out rather
    than deleting it, so the unconfined write would have had somewhere to land.

    The oracle is the DEGRADE, not a raise. This runs inside the commit window's
    except arms, so anything escaping displaces the escalation those arms carry —
    `UnconfinedWriteError` is an `OSError` precisely so the refusal lands in the
    existing guard and is journaled. The last assertion is the one that pins the
    fix: the escaped record still holds THIS run's actions, so the prior text

    `TypeError: Journal.append() got multiple values for argument 'kind'`, and

    `self` collides with the bound-method receiver. `ts` did not raise and was worse
