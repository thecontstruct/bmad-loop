    A marker only `repo_root` holds must let the story through AND a marker only
    `project` holds must fail it. The positive leg identifies `repo_root`; the
    negative leg rules out the tempting `project` regression explicitly.

    Deliberately does NOT mock `verify.run_verify_commands`: that mock is what

    the argument rather than the behavior an operator sees.

    The markers are planted BEFORE the run, so `Engine._dev_phase`'s
    `baseline_untracked` snapshot absorbs them and neither can be mistaken for
    proof of work; the passing leg still owes a real diff, which `dev_effect`'s
    edit to the tracked `app/src.txt` supplies.

    `max_dev_attempts=1` keeps the failing leg to one scripted session: a fixable

    stateful operator-authored commands.

    One marker NAME, two plant locations: the repair session writes
    `only-in-repo-root.txt` into `repo_root` on one leg and into `project` on the
    other, and the command probes it RELATIVELY. The only variable is which
    directory holds the file, so rc separates the legs if and only if the commands
    run in `workspace.root`. Planted BY the session rather than before it, because
    a repair that repaired nothing is not the thing under test.

    `max_dev_attempts=2` with the production-reachable `attempt=1` makes the
    `while task.attempt < max_dev_attempts` loop run exactly once, so one scripted
    session covers the whole phase and the failing leg falls out into its DEFER.

    count this story, which never parked at all.

    """CHARACTERIZATION of behavior this change deliberately LEAVES OPEN — not a
    guarantee, and not a gate. It is the shipped answer to the intent's I/O row
    "Eligible phase, attempt resolves a DIFFERENT spec", and it is folded into the
    first `deferred` entry on this change's spec ("the same authorization is also
    never re-validated against spec IDENTITY"). A later change that closes that
    deferral is EXPECTED to rewrite this row rather than be blocked by it.

    What it pins: `park_eligible` is a PHASE-level authorization answering one
    question about ONE observation — was `task.spec_file` already parked at the
    instant the phase was dispatched? Here it was not (the binding is a
    `ready-for-dev` spec), so the phase is eligible. The session then returns a
    result naming a DIFFERENT spec that was already at `awaiting-operator` before
    the phase began, and writes no code at all. The authorization is not
    re-validated against that identity, so the waiver is spent on an inherited
    park declaration the phase was never authorized over, the residue-free tree is
    accepted, and the attempt is journaled as a waived gate.

    ENGINE layer, and the choice is forced rather than preferred: `verify_dev`
    takes `park_eligible` as a bare argument and has no notion of the phase
    binding at all, so at that layer "the authorization was computed about another
    spec" is not expressible — a caller can only assert the value it just passed
    in. Only `_dev_phase` holds both halves: it computes eligibility from
    `task.spec_file` at fresh entry and later hands the session's own
    `result_json["spec_file"]` to the gate. Nothing between the two compares them,
    which is precisely the finding. (No binding or roots gate refuses the
    construction: the foreign spec sits inside `implementation_artifacts`, so
    `spec_within_roots` admits it, and no verify gate reads `result.json`'s
    `story_key`.)

    Ablation, measured rather than predicted: bind eligibility to the returned
    spec identity in `verify_dev` with
    `skip_proof = parked and park_eligible and
    (not task.spec_file or str(spec_path) == task.spec_file)` — and this row fails
    with `ScriptExhausted: no scripted result for session 1-1-a-dev-2`. Note the
    surface it fails on, because it is a consequence and not the assertion below:
    the waiver no longer fires, the residue-free tree owes a diff it never
    produced, `verify_dev` refuses it with "no changes in worktree since baseline
    commit", and the engine asks for the retry the one-entry script cannot supply.
    The refusal is the cause and the `dev-decision` journal entry records it; the
    exhausted script is only how the retry becomes visible. That failure is the
    expected shape of CLOSING the deferral, which is why this row is
    characterization rather than warranty — close it and rewrite this row."""

    The record carries the discriminator ON the entry rather than in its kind,

    the `BaseException` arm would skip its bare `raise` and swap a graceful
    `RunStopped` for a write complaint.

    rollback's) plus the journal line, because a bare suppress would leave this
    invisible: `validate` reports a board parked with no record, never a record

    `OSError` is the injected type deliberately. Unlike `_restore_deferred_closes`
    this site never resolves — the confined writer walks the components below the

    `RuntimeError`-on-symlink-loop cannot arise, and widening the guard here would

    an `OSError` subclass, so a confinement refusal lands in this same arm.

    Patched at the CONFINED binding as bound in `engine` (#593), and still
    FILTERED BY FILENAME. The filter mattered when four sites shared one binding;
    the confined name now has only this one, but `engine.atomic_write_text` still
    exists for the other three — so a patch aimed at the old name would not raise,
    it would simply never fire, which is why the journal row below is the oracle.

    the record loses the only committed route back to the spec.

    `run_verify_commands`' only handler was `except subprocess.TimeoutExpired`, so
    the OSError raised out of the spawn escaped every guard on the engine's
    verification path, landed in `Engine.run`'s catch-all, and wrote `crash.txt`
    with `state.crashed` — a resumable environment problem presented to the

    the rc-based faults already take: escalate, pause, budget untouched.

    The refusal is injected at the spawn boundary rather than by handing the
    engine a broken root, and that is a deliberate limit of this row: the engine
    does most of its git work in the SAME directory the verify child runs in, so a
    genuinely unusable `workspace.root` would fail somewhere earlier and this
    would stop being a test about verify commands at all. Scoped to `shell=True`
    so only the verify child is refused — the engine's git goes through `_run_git`,
    which passes no shell.

# engine never receives an inter-process SIGTERM. The engine honors it in three
# places — the item boundary (`_check_stop_request`) and the two `_run_session`
# raise sites: an `"aborted"` result handed back by the adapter's in-session poll
# (site A), and a hard file still on disk once a session has been recorded and
# saved (site B, the `_post_kill_reconcile`-rescued case). All three take the HARD
# arm: unconditional teardown, `run-stop` carrying `via="stop-request"` and no
# `graceful` flag. These tests lodge the control file directly, exactly as the
# graceful ones do.
#
# A nested auto-sweep child reads a second channel: the OWNING run's dir, published
# by the outermost `run()` and polled by the adapter and by site B's owner leg. That
# leg never consumes — the file belongs to the parent, whose own hard arm has to
# find it to record and attribute the stop — and a nested engine re-raises rather
# than recording, so those tests assert on the propagated exception.

    `follow_symlinks=False` refused a link planted at the record itself and
    nothing above it, so a link at `.bmad-loop/operator/` sent the put-back — the
    PRIOR park's text, read out of the repo — to a path of the planter's choosing.
    A driven session writes under this root all run long, which is what makes the
    directory swap a real move rather than a hypothetical one.

    The redirect is planted BY THE PRE-COMMIT HOOK, which is the only honest place
    for it: `_write_park_record` has already captured the prior and rewritten the
    record by then, so planting earlier would refuse that write instead and this
    row would grade a different site. The hook fires in exactly the window between
    the record write and the rollback, and it moves the real directory out rather
    than deleting it, so the unconfined write would have had somewhere to land.

    The oracle is the DEGRADE, not a raise. This runs inside the commit window's
    except arms, so anything escaping displaces the escalation those arms carry —
    `UnconfinedWriteError` is an `OSError` precisely so the refusal lands in the
    existing guard and is journaled. The last assertion is the one that pins the
    fix: the escaped record still holds THIS run's actions, so the prior text
    never followed the link out.
