    the plain no-follow writer those callers were moved OFF OF staged the same
    spec through `_mkstemp_beside`'s digest fallback. Both arms now walk the one
    `_stage_shortening` ladder, and this row is the anchored twin of the
    path-based row above.

    Reachable exactly where it hurts: specs are named by BMAD's planning skills,
    nothing bounds that name, and an in-checkout spec routes to this arm.

    The staged name is recorded and asserted legal rather than compared to the
    digest, for the sibling row's reason: what has to hold is that the temp fits,
    not which rung produced it.

    Ablation: bypass the ladder — have `_atomic_write_at` call
    `_open_exclusive_at(dir_fd, name + ".", name)` directly — and this reddens
    alone, on `OSError: [Errno 36] File name too long` raised before any

    CPython's `PC/errmap.h` maps `ERROR_FILENAME_EXCED_RANGE` (206) to ENOENT, and
    does not map `ERROR_BUFFER_OVERFLOW` (111) at all — it falls to the EINVAL
    default. So on Windows nothing raises ENAMETOOLONG and only `.winerror`
    carries the distinction: keying the retry on the errno alone left the whole
    fallback DEAD on the one platform where, per `MAX_PATH`, the staged name is
    easiest to overflow.

    Driven through an injected error rather than a real long name because this
    runs on POSIX too, where no path produces winerror 206 — and a
    `skipif(win32)` row would leave the branch unexercised on every CI leg but
    two. The injection is the mechanism the code actually reads
    (`_is_name_too_long`), so it is the predicate under test, not a stand-in.

    The basename is deliberately LONGER than a 16-character digest, which is what
    puts the digest rung on the ladder at all — see the row below for the short
    basename that skips it.

    Asserts the retry STRICTLY SHORTENED rather than matching the digest: what
    has to hold is that the next attempt is narrower than the one that failed,
    not which scheme produced it.

    Ablation: drop the `.winerror` arm of `_is_name_too_long` and all THREE
    win32-injected rows redden together, on the injected `OSError` propagating out
    of `atomic_write_bytes` before any assertion — they share that predicate, so
    no one of them can fail alone under it. The disjointness proof is the row that
