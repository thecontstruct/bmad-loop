"""The shipped profiles' env_fault_patterns, held to both halves of the contract.

A pattern that misses a real provider outage burns a story's retry budget on an
environment fault (the bug that motivated this file). A pattern that fires on
ordinary model output pauses a *healthy* run — the inverse bug, and the worse of
the two, because the miss merely reproduces today's behaviour while the false
positive halts work that was fine. Both halves are cheap to assert and expensive
to rediscover, so the corpora below are the gate: add a line here before
loosening a pattern.

Only two profiles seed patterns, and only because captured output exists for
them. The other four stay inert deliberately — see test_unseeded_profiles_stay_inert.

WHAT BAIT IS FOR. The tmux adapters match against a tmux pane capture, which
contains the MODEL'S OWN OUTPUT: a story about quota handling prints this
vocabulary constantly, in fixtures, banners, acceptance criteria, docs and
assertions. Every BAIT line is something a healthy session plausibly emits.
The opencode adapter is structurally different — the file it scans is
`<task_id>.server.out`, the `opencode serve` process's own stdout/stderr, which
the model cannot write to at all. (NOT `<task_id>.log`, which is that adapter's
curated `[bmad]` conversation transcript and does carry the model's words.) It is
held to the same corpus anyway, because a pattern loose enough to be wrong on a
pane log should not be trusted just because today's log happens to be clean —
and because which file is scanned has already changed once underneath these
patterns.

KNOWN LIMIT, so nobody mistakes a green run here for proof. This gate matches
line-by-line against text, whereas the real pane log is a raw `tmux pipe-pane`
byte stream carrying cursor-addressed repaints (the TUI renders the same file
through pyte — see tui/data.py). Line and column position in that stream do not
correspond to what was on screen. So patterns must not depend on POSITION,
only on content; a positional anchor would pass here and be meaningless in
production.

# bar test_unseeded_profiles_stay_inert states; a plausible-looking string is

    profiles' patterns and scan every tracked file line-by-line.

    bmad-loop is developed by bmad-loop, so this repo's own text is pane-log
    input. Measured against the tree this guard landed on, the withdrawn
    `API Error.*<cause>` pattern matched 44 tracked lines: three outside the test
    suite (a docs/FEATURES.md bullet, a comment in adapters/profile.py, and the
    pattern's OWN line in claude.toml) plus 41 lines of ordinary
    pytest/grep/diff output. So a session working on this repo could classify
    itself as a provider outage, re-arm the budget and halt the run for an
    operator. (#507 counted 37 when it was filed, and named a CHANGELOG entry
    that has since been reworded out of range — the count moves with the tree,
    which is why this asserts zero rather than a number.)

    This is what fails if a future CHANGELOG entry, doc bullet or profile comment
    writes the framing token and a cause on the SAME line; write them separated
    (`API Error` … `<cause>`) instead. Only DELIBERATE_CORPUS_FILES are exempt.

    opencode is out of scope on purpose, not by oversight: the file its patterns
    are matched against is `<task_id>.server.out` (see
    EnvFaultMixin.ENV_FAULT_LOG_SUFFIX), the `opencode serve` process's own
    stdout, which the model cannot write to — so a tracked line matching them is
    inert. Its own profile comment (opencode.toml) does self-quote, and that is
    why that is not a bug.
