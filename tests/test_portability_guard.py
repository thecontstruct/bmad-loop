"""Regression guard against POSIX-only patterns creeping back into the core.

The POSIX-decoupling pass (multiplexer seam + portability fixes) quarantined
every Unix assumption behind a single tmux backend and a handful of
platform-guarded helpers. This guard byte/AST-scans ``src/bmad_loop`` so a new
hard POSIX dependency can't sneak in unnoticed. Each sanctioned exception lives
in an allowlisted file and — outside the wholesale tmux quarantine — carries a
``# portability:`` ack on its line, so exceptions stay deliberate.

The same single-pass scan also carries the two non-POSIX quarantines that have the
identical shape: AGENTS.md's "New core env vars register in ``envvars.py``;
plugin-owned env-var families stay with their plugin" — see
``test_bmad_loop_env_reads_only_in_the_registry`` — and its "all git subprocess
calls go through the ``_run_git`` chokepoint in ``verify.py``" — see
``test_no_git_invocation_outside_verify``.

If this test flags something unexpected, fix the source (route it through the
seam / a platform helper) rather than widening an allowlist.

    knob inline is what made these undiscoverable before the registry existed, so a
    core module must call an ``envvars`` reader rather than touch ``os.environ``
    itself.

    COVERED — the access shape: ``os.environ.get/pop/setdefault``, ``os.getenv``,
    ``os.environ[K]``, the ``key=`` keyword form of each, and ``K in os.environ`` /
    ``not in`` (including as a link in a chained comparison). Each has a POSIX-only
    bytes twin — ``os.environb`` for the mapping forms, ``os.getenvb`` for the
    function — and both twins are covered.

    Crossed with the key spelling: a literal, a same-module constant,
    ``envvars.MUX_BACKEND``, and the registry constant imported in (see
    ``_env_read_key``). Borrowing the registry's own constant while skipping its
    reader is the *likeliest* violation rather than an exotic one — the
    tidy-looking version is the one that gets written — so every key spelling
    resolves. The bytes twins take only the first two: their keys must be bytes,
    and the registry's constants are ``str``, so that half of the cross product
    cannot be written at all rather than being an uncovered case.

    ``ENV_READ_PROBES`` / ``ENV_READ_NON_PROBES`` are that matrix, executable. Read
    them for what is covered; this docstring only argues the boundary.

    NOT COVERED, deliberately — both obscure the *lookup* rather than the key:
    rebinding the mapping (``e = os.environ; e.get(K)``) and ``from os import
    environ``. This is a review tripwire, not a sandbox: it exists to catch the
    change someone writes while trying to do the right thing, not to withstand
    someone routing around it.

    Bulk copies (``dict(os.environ)``, ``{**os.environ}``) are correctly silent:
    they name no variable, so there is no var being defined outside the registry.

    Scoped to reads. Writes are a different act: engine.py, resolve.py, probe.py,
    plugins/bus.py and unity_plugin.py all BUILD a ``BMAD_LOOP_*`` dict to inject
    into a child session, and gates.py hands notify text to osascript/PowerShell the
    same way — all producing side, none of it a second place a var is *defined*.
    Reads of a SessionSpec's ``spec.env`` (adapters/generic.py) are likewise out:
    that is a plain dict handed down in-process, not the environment.

    ⚠️ THIS assertion cannot grade the detector. It says only that today's tree
    carries no unallowlisted finding — equally green when the scan has silently
    stopped scanning. Delete any single branch of the ``envread`` detector and this
    test still passes while exactly the matching ``ENV_READ_PROBES`` rows redden.
    The assertion is the invariant; the probes are the proof it is being checked,
    and neither replaces the other. What this test does grade alone is the
    allowlist: empty ``ENV_READ_ALLOW`` and it fails naming every real read, so a
    green run means the scan saw those reads rather than that it found nothing.

    ⚠️ The prose row in ``ENV_READ_NON_PROBES`` is a CONTROL, not an ablation. A
    ``BMAD_LOOP_*`` mention in a docstring creates no key-position node at all, so
    it stays silent no matter what the detector does — an earlier revision cited it
    as proof of a docstring exclusion in ``_env_read_key`` that was in fact
    unreachable. Keep the row for the property, never as evidence.

    ⚠️ New uncovered shapes keep surfacing here, and that is a property of the
    design rather than a run of bad luck: this is a denylist of access forms, so it
    is only ever as complete as the last sweep over them, and the NOT COVERED list
    is the honest boundary rather than an oversight. Sweep an axis when you touch
    it — every mapping form at once, not the one that prompted the visit — and
    extend the matrix before the branch: add the probe row, watch it fail, then fix
    the scan.

    The exemption is scoped by variable FAMILY, not by file — see
    ``ENV_READ_ALLOW`` for why, and ``ENV_SCOPE_CASES`` for that claim as rows
    rather than prose."""
