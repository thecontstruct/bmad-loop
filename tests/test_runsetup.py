"""Run-composition layer — chiefly `config_digest`, the integrity pin over the
agent-writable config that reaches HOST code execution (issue #461 point 4).

The digest's whole job is to be exact in two directions at once: it must move for
every field that reaches exec, and hold still for everything else. A digest that
under-covers lets a mid-run rewrite through the auto-sweep gate; one that
over-covers refuses every auto-sweep after a `[limits]` live-edit #189 documents
as supported. Both halves are pinned below.

The second concern here is composition atomicity: `compose_run` and
`compose_sweep` publish a run dir before they can know the run will start, and
`make_adapters` raises `SystemExit` from six sites after that point. The unwind
that keeps a failed launch from stranding a resumable-looking empty run is pinned
at the end of the file.
