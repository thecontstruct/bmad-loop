    nothing, and the `error` field on the same record is already dropped.

    Routed like `repo` and NOT like `spec_file`, and the two precedents genuinely
    disagree: a spec filename is the customer's feature name and correlates one spec
    across four kinds, so it is ALIASED. This is a DIRECTORY, journalled by one kind,
    and one run has one spec folder — it correlates nothing, and a `spec` alias would
    additionally be wrong, since that namespace reduces to a basename and every run we
    author would collapse onto the same `epic-*` tail.

    Graded on the field's ABSENCE, because the canary sweep below is a false green on
    its own: `_IDENTIFIER_RE` forbids `/`, so `scrub_json` already collapses any real
    path to `<redacted:str>` and the home path never appears whether the field is routed
    or not. That is precisely the argument `repo`'s own row makes, and the reason both
    are asserted the same way. `target_branch` beside it is the control: identifier-
    shaped by design, so it must come back ALIASED rather than dropped, and it does leak
    through the sweep when unrouted.

    Ablation: drop `stories_root` from `_JOURNAL_DROP_FIELDS` and the presence assertion
    reddens while the canary sweep stays green; drop `target_branch` from
    `_JOURNAL_ALIAS_FIELDS` and the branch assertions redden on BOTH.

    """`target` is a BRANCH on the merge kinds and a sprint STATUS on `board-advance-*`.

    That overload is why the field is absent from `_JOURNAL_ALIAS_FIELDS`: routing there
    is by field NAME, so a single entry would have to be wrong for one of the two
    families. Leaving it unrouted was the wrong half to be wrong on — a bare
    `main`/`release`-style branch name is identifier-shaped, so `scrub_json` ships it
    VERBATIM into a bundle whose guiding assumption is that it will be posted publicly.

    The backstop is not the answer here. It repairs only values already in the legend,
    so it rescues this exactly when `ensure_target_branch` journalled the same string as
    `branch` earlier in the same file — and then discloses a `backstop_repairs` gap on a
    routine run. A journal truncated past that event has nothing to repair from.

    Both directions are graded, because either alone is satisfied by a wrong fix:

    - the three merge kinds ALIAS, to the branch namespace, and to the SAME alias as the
      `branch` field beside them when the value matches — a by-name entry would pass
      this too.
    - `board-advance-carried` keeps its `target` VERBATIM. A by-name entry reddens here,
      rendering the sprint status a maintainer reads that kind for as `branch-<hex>`.

    Separator-free names throughout: `_IDENTIFIER_RE` forbids `/`, so a `feature/x`
    spelling is collapsed by the FALLBACK and every assertion below would pass with the
    routing deleted (the same false green documented for `repo` above).

    """The two state fields this wave ADDED must be legible in a bug report.

    `RunState.repo_root` and `StoryTask.generation` are new here, and both name the
    exact conditions under which the re-anchored gates and the re-minted session ids
    behave differently — yet neither reached the projection. `repo` was simultaneously
    dropped from journal records (correctly: an absolute host path), which removed the
    last trace of a split root from a dump altogether.

    `generation` matters because without it a #705-class replay dumps as
    `rearmed=True, attempt=1, n_sessions=2` — byte-identical to a HEALTHY post-re-arm
    task, so the one field that separates "minted a fresh id" from "collided with the
    abandoned record" is the one a triager cannot see.

    Both are privacy-safe by construction and are asserted to be: a boolean in the
    `paused_reason_present` / `worktree_isolated` style, and a small counter. The path
    itself must NOT appear — that is what `_JOURNAL_DROP_FIELDS` drops.

    `escalations_resolved_upto` (DW-11) is projected on the same warrant and asserted
    here for the same reason: a task whose older escalations are filtered out of
    `context.json` dumps identically to one that only ever raised the entries shown,
    so a support bundle cannot explain a short resolve context without it. A counter
    too — it indexes `task.sessions`, so it carries no customer content.

    Ablation: delete `repo_root_diverges=` from `collect_run` (or `generation=` /
    `escalations_resolved_upto=` from `_task_diag`) and this reddens on the
    corresponding assertion; deleting the field from the dataclass reddens as a
    TypeError at construction.

    The sibling tests above grade the collector, which is what `--json` dumps whole via
    `asdict`. The markdown report is a different renderer that samples fields by hand,
    and it is the artifact an operator actually produces and hands a maintainer — the
    header says so ("Safe to share"). A field whose entire warrant is "a bug report that
    cannot show this cannot be triaged" is not delivered until it renders here, so the
    warrant is graded where it is spent.

    `generation` rides beside `attempt` because that is the column pair a #705-class
    replay turns on: a collided re-drive and a healthy post-re-arm task agree on every
    other cell in this row. DW-11's `escalations_resolved_upto` rides beside it on the
    same warrant, stated verbatim in its own field comment: it is the only field that
    separates "this story raised one escalation" from "its earlier ones are filtered
    out of `context.json` as already answered", and that question is asked of a bug
    report. Seeded to a value that is neither the attempt, the generation nor the
    review cycle, so a cell reading a NEIGHBOUR cannot pass.

    Ablation: drop the `code root differs from project` line from `render_markdown` and
    both this test and the sibling below redden on their first assertion. Drop
    `{t.generation}` from the row f-string together with its header and separator cells
    and this test reddens at `names[4]` (`"esc-upto" != "gen"`) while the sibling
    reddens at the row cell — the review cycle shifted left rather than a missing key,
    which is why the cell is read positionally and the three widths are compared. Drop
    `{t.escalations_resolved_upto}` the same way and this test reddens at `names[5]`
    (`"rev" != "esc-upto"`); drop ONLY the row cell and it reddens on the width
    comparison, which is what a skewed table actually looks like.
