    """The two records `runs.rearm_escalation` added must be routed by FIELD NAME,
    not left to the `scrub_json` fallback (#640, #716).

    `repo` is an absolute host path naming the run's code tree, and the fallback
    fails closed only by accident of shape — `looks_like_identifier` forbids `/`,
    so a POSIX root collapses, but a one-segment root would ship verbatim. It is
    DROPPED rather than aliased: one run has one code root, so it correlates
    nothing, and the `error` field on the same record is already dropped.

    `spec_file` is the customer's feature name (the very hazard
    `_JOURNAL_ALIAS_FIELDS`' `spec` entry exists for) and is ALIASED, so a
    maintainer can still follow one spec across events.

    `overwritten` and `baseline` are both shas on one record, so aliasing one and
    leaving the other would pseudonymize half a comparison — the assertion below
    is that BOTH come back aliased and DIFFERENT from each other.

    Ablation: drop `repo` from `_JOURNAL_DROP_FIELDS` and the PRESENCE assertion
    below reddens — not the canary sweep, which stays green because `scrub_json`
    already collapses an absolute path to `<redacted:str>` (verified by running that
    ablation: `repo` comes back as `'<redacted:str>'`, so the canary never appears).
    That is the whole point of the drop: the fallback happens to redact THIS path
    shape, so only an assertion on the field's absence can grade a routing decision
    taken for a shape the fallback would not catch. Drop `spec_file` or `overwritten`
    from `_JOURNAL_ALIAS_FIELDS` and the alias assertions redden (`spec_file` on the
    canary sweep too). Drop `target_branch` and the branch row reddens on BOTH the alias
    lookup and the canary sweep — that field is identifier-shaped by design, so unlike
    `repo` the fallback does not accidentally rescue it.

    """`target` is a BRANCH on the merge kinds and a sprint STATUS on `board-advance-*`.

    That overload is why the field is absent from `_JOURNAL_ALIAS_FIELDS`: routing there
    is by field NAME, so a single entry would have to be wrong for one of the two
    families. Leaving it unrouted was the wrong half to be wrong on — a bare
    `main`/`release`-style branch name is identifier-shaped, so `scrub_json` ships it
    VERBATIM into a bundle whose guiding assumption is that it will be posted publicly.

    The backstop is not the answer here. It repairs only values already in the legend,
    so it rescues this exactly when `ensure_target_branch` journalled the same string as
    `branch` earlier in the same file — and then discloses a `backstop_repairs` gap on a
    routine run. A journal truncated past that event has nothing to repair from.

    Both directions are graded, because either alone is satisfied by a wrong fix:

    - the three merge kinds ALIAS, to the branch namespace, and to the SAME alias as the
      `branch` field beside them when the value matches — a by-name entry would pass
      this too.
    - `board-advance-carried` keeps its `target` VERBATIM. A by-name entry reddens here,
      rendering the sprint status a maintainer reads that kind for as `branch-<hex>`.

    Separator-free names throughout: `_IDENTIFIER_RE` forbids `/`, so a `feature/x`
    spelling is collapsed by the FALLBACK and every assertion below would pass with the
    routing deleted (the same false green documented for `repo` above).

    Ablation: empty `_JOURNAL_KIND_ALIAS_FIELDS` and the three merge rows redden on the
    legend lookup (`StopIteration`); move `"target": "branch"` into
    `_JOURNAL_ALIAS_FIELDS` instead and the board-advance row reddens on the status.
