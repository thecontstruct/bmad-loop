"""Coding-CLI adapter-registry selection + discovery proof.

The CLI axis selects its adapter *class* through a registry
(:func:`~bmad_loop.adapters.registry.register_adapter`) keyed on the
``profile.adapter`` field, rather than name-branching in
``runsetup.make_adapters``. So a new adapter family is a registration — not a core
edit — exactly as a new transport backend is
(:mod:`bmad_loop.adapters.multiplexer`). These tests pin the registry (builtin +
external registration, builtins-first-wins, unknown-kind fail-loud), the
out-of-tree entry-point discovery and its degrade-not-crash contract, and the
``runsetup.make_adapters`` dispatch: a registered kind builds, the
``(cfg, synthesizes)`` cache shares instances, ``needs_mux`` gates the transport
resolution, a construction failure becomes a clean ``SystemExit``, the
digest-gated ``profiles=`` mapping decides the kind, and — the regression pin —
``opencode-http`` still dispatches to the HTTP adapters unchanged.

The registry is deliberately simpler than the multiplexer seam: adapters are built
per-run (``runsetup.make_adapters`` owns the cache), so there is no ``lru_cache`` /
``cache_clear`` and no ``configure_*`` / platform-default machinery — the
``fresh_adapter_registry`` fixture snapshots only ``_ADAPTERS`` / the two loaded
flags / ``_EXTERNAL_ERRORS``.

Entry points are faked by monkeypatching ``importlib.metadata.entry_points``
through the ``registry`` module's own binding; one test builds a real
``*.dist-info`` on ``sys.path`` to prove the scan works against genuine packaging
metadata.
