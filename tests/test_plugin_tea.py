"""Phase 2: the bundled Test Architect Enterprise (TEA) plugin.

Four layers:

  * **manifest** — the shipped ``data/plugins/tea`` loads as a builtin, trust-gated
    ``[python]`` plugin with the six TEA workflows and the enable/blocking settings;
  * **readiness gate** — ``TeaPlugin.validate`` fails fast when TEA is not installed
    (``require_tea`` on), passes when it is, and is skipped when ``require_tea`` is off;
  * **injection (runs)** — enabling ``tea`` injects three ``post_dev_phase`` + three
    ``post_review_result`` sessions, in order, for a normal story run;
  * **injection (sweeps)** — a ``SweepEngine`` bundle drives the same six workflows
    through the inherited pipeline, with no sweep-specific code;
  * **enable setting** — ``automate_enabled = false`` suppresses just that workflow.

The injected sessions are scripted with the same ``workflow_effect`` stand-in used
by ``test_plugin_workflows`` (capture the spec, return a status) so we assert the
prompt label / task_id and the ``workflow-start``/``-end`` journal trail without a
real TEA install or CLI.
