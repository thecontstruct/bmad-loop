"""Unit tests for the WorktreeFlow collaborator (issue #244 F-3/F-9a).

WorktreeFlow was carved out of Engine's worktree isolation/integration cluster.
These exercise it in isolation — built from narrow deps + stub engine callbacks,
no Engine instance — which is the point of the extraction. End-to-end behavior
under a real Engine stays covered by test_engine_worktree.py.

    swallowed into a hooks-only rewrite.

    The raise site is unit-covered in test_install.py; this pins the routing, and that
    the generalized wrapper carries the inner message through INTACT. That message is
    the whole diagnostic — it names the file the operator has to fix — so a wrapper
    that summarized instead of quoting would leave the pause unactionable.

    Ablation: delete the provisioning ``GitError`` catch in ``run_isolated`` and this
