# ================================================= the value / comment split
#
# #366. `_set_mapping_value` decides where a line's scalar ends and a trailing
# inline comment begins, and NOTHING checks that guess afterwards: `advance` has
# no oracle at all, and the one a caller might reach for cannot see this class of
# error anyway — `yaml.safe_load` strips comments before it could compare, so a
# line rewritten with a comment invented out of the tail of a quoted value
# re-parses as a perfectly clean `3-2-x: done`. (Proven by ablation on the sibling
# defect, PR #365, whose three verification gates all passed the fabricated
# comment.) The pattern is therefore the gate here, and these tests hold it.
#
# Called directly rather than through `advance` wherever the shape under test is
# a REFUSAL: `advance` answers a refused line and a story already at target with
# the same unchanged status, so only the writer's own return separates them.
# Every assertion is on the FULL resulting text — a substring or a re-parse is
# blind to exactly the fabrication these are here to catch.

    into a comment the board never had and truncating the value it came from. A
    quote-led remainder is taken whole instead, which drops nothing that was

    Formerly `test_advance_holds_the_lock_across_every_read_and_the_write`, which

    relaxed it deliberately: `advance` now runs ONE advisory pre-lock read to
    answer the calls that would write nothing, so an idempotent replay no longer
    fails on contention for work it was never going to do. What survives — and is
    the whole protection — is that the reads feeding the published bytes still
    happen after the acquisition.

    A lock taken around the atomic write alone excludes nobody that matters: the
    bytes being published were computed from a read that happened OUTSIDE it, so
    a rival's advance can land in between and be overwritten wholesale. The
    ordering is recorded from the calls themselves rather than inferred from the
    result, because a lost update leaves a board that looks perfectly well-formed.

    `load` is the probe for three of the four reads — the advisory probe, the
    inside-the-lock `story_status` never-regress read, and the epic-lift read all
    go through it — and the writer spy is the fourth event. Advancing a `backlog`
    story of a `backlog` epic is what makes the epic lift fire, and a `backlog`
    row is exactly what the advisory probe declines to answer, so the fall-through
    and all three inside events are present.

    Ablation A: make `_advance_locked` reuse the probe's answer instead of its own
    read (hoist the `current = story_status(...)` out and pass it in) and this

    the never-regress decision saw the board the write is applied to.

    A rival process completes its whole advance while this one is still queued

    computes its bytes from the board the rival left behind, and both flips
    survive. Read the board before the lock instead and the rival's row is
    absent from the bytes published over it — gone, with no error anywhere.

    The rival runs from inside the spy, BEFORE it enters the real lock, which is
    what a second process actually gets to do; running it after would nest a
    blocking acquisition on a second fd and self-deadlock. The one-shot latch
    stops the rival's own `advance` from recursing into another rival.

    The rival's row must be one its advance really REWRITES — `4-1-thing` moves
    `review` -> `done`. A rival whose advance never-regresses writes nothing, and
    there is then no update available to lose: the test would pass against every
    ablation, including no lock at all.

    that read decides never-regress, it does not produce the bytes published over
    the rival, and its position is graded by the ordering row above instead.

    Read#1 above the lock is no longer hypothetical — it is what `advance` does
    (#736): the advisory probe reads exactly that, and this row is why doing so
    is safe. The probe declines to answer a row that must move (`3-2-digest-
    delivery` is `backlog`, below its target), so this call falls through to the
    hold and recomputes read#1 there, which is the read the rival's flip has to

    `StateRootError` when no state root can be derived — and `StateRootError` is
    NOT an `OSError`, so it escapes on its own taxonomy. Before the probe, that
    made an already-done board's replay fail outright. Now it cannot: the answer
    is reached without ever asking for a lock path.

    The second half is the load-bearing half. A probe that made the lock
    optional, rather than unnecessary, would be a far worse bug than the one
    being fixed — so the same fault on a call that really does write must still
    surface. `3-2-digest-delivery` is `backlog`, so advancing it to `in-progress`
    is a genuine write and has to raise.

    Patching the module attribute reaches the real call site because
    `_board_lock`'s `from . import runs` is deliberately lazy (the import cycle
    runs → verify → sprintstatus forbids a top-level one), so the lookup happens
    per call against the patched module.

    Ablation: delete the probe and the FIRST call raises `StateRootError` — the
    behavior #736 filed."""

    """The probe is advisory: a fault in it decides nothing (#736).

    An unreadable board makes `story_status` raise inside the probe, and the
    probe swallows it — deliberately broadly, because narrowing the catch would
    let the probe invent a failure the locked path does not have. The call then
    falls through and the locked body raises `SprintStatusError` on exactly the
    channel `cli.py`'s error routing already expects.

    The ACQUISITION COUNT is the oracle, not the raise. `pytest.raises` alone
    survives removing the try/except entirely — the probe's own uncaught
    `SprintStatusError` is the same class, from the same reader, and would pass
    this row while never having reached the lock at all. Only `len(entered) == 1`
    tells the two apart.

    The probe reads outside all exclusion, so between it and the hold a rival can
    move the row anywhere — including PAST the target this call is carrying. If
    that stale answer were carried into `_advance_locked` instead of being
    re-read, the never-regress test would be applied to a status the board no
    longer has and the rival's forward progress would be rewritten backwards. The
    published bytes are decided under the hold precisely so this cannot happen.

    The rival runs from inside the `_board_lock` spy, BEFORE it enters the real
    lock, which is what a second process actually gets to do; running it after
    would nest a blocking acquisition on a second fd and self-deadlock. The
    one-shot latch stops the rival's own `advance` from recursing into another
    rival. Both calls target the SAME row — that is the point, unlike the
    lost-update row above, which needs two different rows.

    Ablation: thread the probe's answer into `_advance_locked` (hoist its
    `current = story_status(...)` read and pass the probe's value in) and this
