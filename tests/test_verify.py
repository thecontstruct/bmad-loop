# `*`, `?` and `:` are all reserved in Windows FILENAMES (`:` is the drive
# separator), so a fixture that must CREATE a directory carrying one is
# Linux-only — `mkdir` raises WinError 123 before the test can assert anything.

# also the realistic carrier since `implementation_artifacts` comes out of the
# operator's config, so the bracket rows stay unmarked and cover both CI
# platforms. Note this constrains only fixture FILENAMES: a pathspec STRING
# containing `*` is just a string, so the rows that merely pass `doc*` as a
