    `[scm] isolation` is re-read on every resume and a change is journaled, never
    refused, so `worktree -> none` reaches the restart arm with a mount still recorded.
    That arm re-runs in place, and the leg below it hands `baseline_commit` /
    `baseline_untracked` to `recovery_flow.rollback_or_pause` — but both were stamped
    from `self.workspace.root`, the UNIT, and the workspace is now the main checkout.

    Neither operand fails loud there. Linked worktrees share the object database, so
    the unit baseline still resolves and a reset onto it succeeds; and a fresh
    worktree is a tracked-only checkout, so its empty `baseline_untracked` makes
    `verify._rollback_cleanup_plan` compute `untracked_files(repo) -
    baseline_untracked` as EVERY untracked file in the operator's own checkout. Under
    an auto-recovering cause those are deleted outright — the operator's own files,
    for a story that merely changed isolation mode.

    Graded on the rollback leg not being entered at all, rather than only on the
    cleared fields: the fields are the mechanism, the un-entered leg is the property.

    The mount's CLAIM and the mount's DIRECTORY are separated, and both are asserted.
    `worktree_path` names a directory and is also how `runs` answers the RETROSPECTIVE
    question — which tree owns the state this task already persisted (`task_spec_root`,
    `task_stories_root`) — so a task that keeps the field set while executing in the
    main checkout makes those readers answer for a tree the run has left. The directory
    itself stays: this arm did not build it, and a policy change is not an instruction
    to delete the operator's tree. The orphan is journaled so that is not silent.

    The PROSPECTIVE readers are deliberately absent from that list and from the
    assertions below. `redrive_base_ref` and `spec_reaches_the_redrive` describe the
    re-drive that has not happened yet, and they take the live isolation mode as a
    parameter rather than inferring it here — because `bmad-loop resolve` asks them in
    a separate process BEFORE this resume runs, where no amount of claim-clearing is
    visible. Asserting them here would grade the argument this test passes them, not
    the field it is about; `test_redrive_base_ref_reads_live_policy_not_the_recorded_mount`
    (tests/test_runs.py) carries that direction against both flips.

    Ablation: narrow the arm back to `release_spec_paths_from_mount()` and this
    reddens on the spy — the leg fires with the unit's operands, which is the state
    that would have deleted them. Separately, drop the `worktree_path = ""` and the
    claim assertions redden while the spy stays green, which is why both are here.

    tolerated by the row above — but not when it sits on a path the RUN itself
    commits after the merge, and the sprint board is one of those.

    `_carry_board_advance` calls `verify.commit_paths`, which runs
    `git add -- :(literal)<board>` and then a pathspec commit, so it takes whatever
    the working tree holds at that path no matter who wrote it. Left tolerated, the
    operator's private edit rides out under `chore(sprint-status): carry 1-1-a to
    done` — their bytes, the run's name, and a CLEAN tree afterwards, which is
    exactly why nothing surfaces it.

    Reaching that requires the board to be dirty in the main checkout AND outside the
    branch's incoming set, and this row's setup is the shape that produces it rather
    than decoration:

    * the board is committed with the row ALREADY at the target, so the unit

      and the board never enters `finalize_commit`'s `git add -A`. It is a stray, not
      an incoming collision — the ordinary tracked board rides the merge instead, and
      a stray inside the incoming set would be restored rather than swept.
    * the operator reopens the row in their own checkout WITHOUT committing, which is
      what `_pick_next` (main board, on disk) reads to pick the story at all, and
      appends a private note beside it.

    The last assertion reads git history, not the working tree, and that is the whole
    point: the measured failure leaves the tree clean and the file's bytes unchanged

    says "before anything else" and has to mean it. The untracked clause then
    defers ("Then clear those") instead of also claiming first place — the
    composed message used to say "Clear those first" and "before anything else"
    about two different steps in the same breath.

    Both `.index` calls double as presence asserts (ValueError = red), so the
    row pins composition AND order in one place.

    Ablation: swap the two `steps.append` blocks back and this row fails on the

):
    """#619: `merge_local` caught every `verify.GitError` out of `merge_branch` and
    told the operator to resolve "a content conflict against the target". Most of
    those failures are git declining at pre-flight — nothing merged, the checkout
    untouched, no markers anywhere — so the guidance sent them looking for a
    conflict that does not exist. `MergePreflightError` is a GitError subclass, so
    the two arms must be ordered subclass-first for the split to exist at all.

    Each row asserts its own phrase PRESENT and every OTHER row's phrase ABSENT. The
    absence half is the discriminator: a single catch-all arm still makes each row's
    own phrase appear on one of them, and only the cross-check catches the collapse.
    Every other rather than one neighbour, because past two arms a pair can collapse
    into each other while the rest stay distinct.

    `commit-refused` is the third state (#619): git merged cleanly and then declined
    to COMMIT — a `pre-merge-commit`/`commit-msg` hook, or a signing step. Its arm
    exists because neither neighbour's remedy fits it.

    `commit-refused-unrestored` is that state with the abort ALSO failed. It is a
    row and not a footnote because the two differ in what the operator must do
    FIRST: a resume over a mid-merge checkout dies on the merge state however well
    they fix the hook, so a message claiming the checkout was restored costs them
    the one step that unblocks it.

    `commit-refused-staged` is the squash leg's strand of that same state: its
    commit is the leg's own `git commit` after the merge already staged the
    result, so there is no MERGE_HEAD and "recover the merge" would be fiction —
    the squash result is sitting STAGED and clearing it is the first step. The
    `staged` flag is what parts the two unrestored wordings, which is the row's
    whole point.

    `content-conflict` pins the TYPED conflict arm: the conflict is measured
    (unmerged stages) and raised as `MergeConflictError`, so the resolve-by-hand
    wording rides the measurement rather than the absence of a better match.

    `unclassified` pins the demoted catch-all. A bare `GitError` is a state
    nothing measured, and the arm now says so — run `git status`, git's text
    names the cause — instead of prescribing conflict resolution for it. Six
    mislabeled git states in a row reached operators through the old wording;
    this row is what turns a hypothetical seventh into a vague-but-true message
    instead of a precise fiction.

    `half-applied` is the fourth state: git died part-way through the checkout and
    left incoming files behind, untracked. It reaches `merge_local` as a SIBLING of
    the pre-flight error rather than a subclass, so it needs an arm of its own —
    and it is the row the cross-check matters most for, since the phrase it must
    never carry is the pre-flight arm's "the target checkout is unchanged" claim,
    which is false here in the exact clause the operator acts on.

    `residue-unread` is the terminal state: the merge failed and the post-merge
    residue reading failed too, so neither the pre-flight claim (the checkout is
    unchanged) nor the half-applied one (these files were left) is available. Its
    arm says the state is UNVERIFIED and sends the operator to their own
    `git status` — the reading the run could not take. Without the arm it falls
    to the content-conflict catch-all, which is the #619 defect wearing a probe
    error's text.

    Ablation: delete either subclass arm from `merge_local` and its rows fail on
    both halves while the others stay green; collapse the `e.restored` branch to the
    restored wording and only `commit-refused-unrestored` reddens. Every verify-layer
    row stays green throughout, because this is the wiring axis and those are the
    predicate axis."""

    `_close_declared_deferred` writes `self.workspace.paths.deferred_work`, which
    under isolation is the unit worktree's ledger. With the ledger GITIGNORED —
    the default shape, since the ledger lives in the BMAD artifacts dir — the flip
    lands in the worktree, is skipped in silence by `finalize_commit`'s `git add
    -A` (a worktree-scoped exclude shields every seeded rel), brings nothing over
    with the merge, and dies with the worktree at `close_unit_workspace`. Nothing
    in `_carry_isolated_ledger_writes` carries it: that hook owns the harvest and
    the review-budget follow-up, both APPENDS, and a declared close is neither.

    The fixture encodes that false success: the worktree ledger ends `status: done`
    with the resolution annotation, and the journal carries `story-deferred-closed
    dw_ids=['DW-1']` with no `deferred-close-unmatched`. Without the carry the main
    checkout's ledger still reads `status: open` — the run reports a close it never
    delivered. Ablating the seed (`_ledger_seed` -> `()`) puts the pre-seed behavior
    back: the worktree ledger is ABSENT, `classify` reports the id unmatched, and the
    run journals `deferred-close-unmatched dw_ids=['DW-1']`. Louder, equally lost.

    Tracked is the contrast, not a second defect: the sibling above measures the
    same story against a TRACKED ledger and the close rides the unit commit into
    the merge — no seed is made, so no exclude shields it. The fix therefore needs
    no tracked/ignored predicate, only an idempotent carry (re-applying a close
    the merge already delivered is a no-op, exactly as
    `test_tracked_damped_followup_is_not_refiled_twice_by_the_carry` relies on).

    RED here is the last three assertions: the main checkout must end up with the

    taking bytes the run never wrote. `_replay_unlatched_ledger_carries` skips it:
    the re-merge block is guarded on `merged_key not in merged_units`, so a unit whose

    `unit-merged` in the crashed run's journal is that leg's precondition and is

    re-runs the merge, and the pre-flight would have caught the edit after all —

    shape where the carry's own docstring promise (`board-advance-carry-failed`
    for "a board that is gone") and its probes' behavior used to disagree.

    Deletion is dirt (` D` in `dirty_paths`), so it turns proving ON — and the
    pre-advance row probe's live read (`sprint_story_status` → `load`) RAISES
    `SprintStatusError` over a missing file, where `advance`, whose behavior the
    no-catch rationale was written against, returns None. That raise escaped
    `_replay_unlatched_ledger_carries` (which catches only `RunPaused`), so every
    resume died before `_loop()` — the one caller every resume runs through, on a
    shape a retry cannot repair. The carry now refuses a missing board up front,
    on the journal row already named for it.

    Driven through `_replay_unlatched_ledger_carries` itself so the raise, when
    the guard is ablated, is the failure graded — a full `resumed.run()` would
    also trip over the missing board in `_pick_next` and muddy the axis.

    perfectly and the damage is invisible until run 2 — inside a single run

    `_pick_next`'s own reader, against `ACTIONABLE_STATUSES`, over the file the
