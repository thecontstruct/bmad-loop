    file's resume sites now share.

    `cli.cmd_resume` constructs `Journal(run_dir)` and passes it to
    `runsetup.compose_resume`; a fresh `Journal` starts with `_log_task = None`.
    Sharing one object carried the PRE-PAUSE session's `set_active_log` binding across
    the resume boundary, and `Journal.append` stamps `log_task`/`log_pos` onto every
    entry while that binding is set — so every row a resumed engine writes BEFORE
    starting its own session (a replay pre-pass, a resume-carry, a merge replay) was
    stamped with a log from the run before the pause. A real resume writes those rows
    bare. `Journal` holds NO in-memory record list — `append` writes one line to
    `run_dir/journal.jsonl` and `entries()` re-reads it — so the binding is the only
    state a shared object could leak; every `journal_kinds(resumed)` claim in this
    file's resume rows was already round-tripping through disk.

    Graded on the CONSEQUENCE, never on object identity: `resumed.journal is not

    nothing observable.

    the pre-pause `log_task` and `log_pos`. That one only: the two `first[...]` lines

    No `accepted-spec-delivery-unreachable` here: this is the RELOCATED leg, and it
    escalates. Stated as an OBSERVATION, not as a graded claim — the ablation does
    not exist for it. Deleting the `if not accepted_spec_relocated:` gate at the
    call site leaves this row green, because the escalation above raises
    `RunPaused` before control ever reaches that call. The gate is belt-and-braces
    over a probe that would answer the same way anyway, and the only shape that
    could tell the two apart is a main checkout whose own symlinks make the
    locator's rel differ from `task.spec_file`. What this row does grade is the
    absence a reader would otherwise have to take on trust: a relocated unit that
    escalates leaves exactly one advisory RECORD — none — alongside the
    `worktree-seed-dropped` entry the seed refusal still emits.

    raises first and folds the pair to None (measured on 3.13 and 3.14). What this
    row grades is therefore the arm's totality against the faults that CAN reach
    it — a TOCTOU between the locator's resolve and this stat, or a non-EACCES
    OSError — not the unsearchable-parent story, which lands on the mount arm
    below.

    Ablation: restore `source.is_file()` on the left conjunct and this row reddens
    with a `PermissionError` escaping `run_isolated`, while the mount-side row
    below stays green.

    The BARE BASENAME spelling is load-bearing, not incidental. `_accepted_spec_pair`
    resolves a relative spec through `verify.resolve_spec_path`, whose own
    `candidate.is_file()` is raw and sits inside the locator's `except OSError` — so
    spelling the full project-relative rel points that probe at this very path, the
    locator folds to None first, and the seed returns `()` no matter which probe its
    existence arm uses. A basename makes `resolve_spec_path` probe
    `project/<basename>` (absent, unfaulted) and fall back to the
    implementation-artifacts copy UNPROBED, so the seed's own arm is the first
    thing to touch the faulted path. Re-spell this as the full rel and the row
    goes green against the bug it is here to pin.

    worktree is journaled under its own kind, and the run still completes.

    The obstruction is the real copier's, not a mock's: a plain FILE tracked at the
    skill's destination rel is carried into the checkout by `git worktree add`, and
    `_copy_traversable`'s no-clobber then prunes the whole subtree at its root (a
    non-directory squatting a directory target wins, and mkdir must never replace
    it). So the copy loop lands nothing and the real predicate reports it under the
    real engine.

    `attach_profile` is REQUIRED, not decoration: MockAdapter deliberately carries
    no profile, `worktree_profiles` then yields no skill trees at all, and the
    MODULE_SKILLS copy loop and this predicate never run — the test would pass
    while asserting nothing.

    Ablation: delete the `module_skills_seed_undelivered` call (or its journal
    append) in `WorktreeFlow.run_isolated` and the entry assertion fails; route its

    name the path twice: claude's `seed_files` carries `.claude/settings.json`, which
    is also its `config_path`, so claude worked by coincidence; codex's carries
    `.codex/config.toml` and NOT `.codex/hooks.json`, so a codex stage ran without the

    ⚠️ THE FIXTURE MUST BE CODEX, and this test ablated GREEN when it was written with

    derivation is a no-op there and the test could not tell the fix from the bug. The
    coincidence #471 reports is the same thing that makes claude useless as a fixture.

    sibling publishers already take, on the operand this one hands to `git add`,
    for each of the three DURABLE causes.

    The refusal never RAISES, where this method's `GitError` can: `may_degrade` asks
    whether git can own the ledger, and a refusal answers a different question — the
    operand is not a publishable file at all — which a replay re-reads and refuses
    identically, so raising would cost the run its `integrate_unit` with nothing left
    to retry. Every other statement in the frame is untouched: the latch clears and
    `harvest-carried` is still journaled.

    The three rows are three different things git would otherwise have done. A
    DIRECTORY is staged recursively (`swept-in.txt` under a `chore(deferred-work):`
    message). An ABSENT tracked ledger — unlinked after the append — is the
    missing-but-TRACKED deletion `commit_paths` deliberately stages, which would
    commit the ledger AWAY. Invalid UTF-8 is the one that, before DW-237's split,
    arrived as `target-unreadable` and fell through: git
    accepts any bytes, so the corrupt ledger reached HEAD; the guard now names it
    `target-undecodable`, a durable cause, and it refuses here like the other two
    while the transient `target-unreadable` still falls through (see the latch row
    below). Every replacement is staged AFTER the append for the reason
    `_replace_with_a_directory` states.

    "No git" is graded at the call as well as on the outcome: a recording wrapper
    around `verify.commit_paths` must see NO call, since an unchanged HEAD alone
    would not tell a refusal from a `git add` that failed or staged read-only.

    Ablation: delete the `refusal = _publication_refusal(...)` branch here and every
    row reds — the directory row on `swept-in.txt` reaching `git ls-files`, the absent
    row on HEAD advancing to the ledger's deletion, the undecodable row on HEAD
    advancing to the corrupt blob — and all three on the `commit_paths` call count.

    `target-absent`, `target-not-a-file` and `target-undecodable` are durable on-disk

    (the row above grades all three). `target-unreadable` is
    whatever a probe RAISED — an EACCES parent here, a WinError 64 from a
    registered-but-not-serving UNC provider on the original DW-195/#552 report — and
    the next pass may well not see it. This publisher alone carries a durable
    `harvest_carry_commit_pending` latch, so turning that cause into a refusal would
    journal an advisory success and clear the commit obligation forever. It falls
    through to `may_degrade`/`commit_paths` instead, exactly as it did before the
    guard landed: a TRACKED ledger may not degrade, so the `GitError` is re-raised
    and the latch survives for the replay.

    Both probes are faulted because a real unsearchable parent faults both: `stat` is
    what `unpublishable_target`'s `"ledger"` leg reaches through
    `deferredwork.read_for_write`, and `lstat` is `commit_paths`' own presence probe
    since DW-239. Injected AFTER the append for the reason

    produces a carry to publish.

    `Path.resolve()` raises `ValueError` for an embedded NUL (`lstat: embedded null
    character in path` on 3.12+; `embedded null byte` on 3.11) and
    `UnicodeEncodeError` (a `ValueError` subclass) for a lone surrogate outside the
    `surrogateescape` range on CPython 3.11-3.14 POSIX, and the
    two-class tuple that stood here let both escape best-effort bookkeeping whose
    whole degrade discipline exists to prevent exactly that. The fold lands on
    `target-unreadable` with `str(e)` as its text — the same transient cause the
    `OSError`/`RuntimeError` classes take, for the reason the docstring gives: a
    caller reads the cause alone and never asks which call produced it.

    INJECTED through `refuse_to_resolve(..., error=)` rather than driven with a real
    NUL so the row holds on every supported interpreter and platform:
    `ntpath.realpath` tolerates a NUL, so neither is a cross-platform driver at the
    publisher. The real-driver sibling below shows both stand-ins match what
    `Path.resolve()` actually raises on POSIX.

    The third member of the pair `_defer` and `_run_story` already select on. An
    accepted continuation reopens the recorded mount REGARDLESS of live policy —
    `_finish_inflight` swaps `self.workspace` onto it, and `self._isolated` is a
    read-only property over LIVE policy with no setter anywhere — so a run whose
    `scm.isolation` was edited `"worktree" -> "none"` while it was paused reaches this

    committed the mounted work for `_integrate_unit` to merge out: a timed-out review
    landing DONE-and-merged, where the identical work under unchanged policy defers
    with the unit's worktree and diff kept for review.

    The bytes assertion is the discriminator, not the return value. The `in-review`

    what `_finish_inflight` leaves after an `isolation` flip across a resume, since it
    sets only `self.workspace` and `self._isolated` keeps reading live policy. Selected
    on policy alone, the rescue committed a story that never converged; `_commit` lands
    in the mount and `_integrate_unit` merges that unit branch out to the target, so
    the outcome inverts — DONE-and-merged instead of DEFERRED with the unit's worktree
    and patch preserved.

    The gate is inline in `_review_and_commit`, so a full sandbox run is the lowest

    pinned high, or the damping converges the story before exhaustion and this row

    """The mount-measured operands must not reach a rollback of the MAIN checkout.

    `[scm] isolation` is re-read on every resume and a change is journaled, never
    refused, so `worktree -> none` reaches the restart arm with a mount still recorded.
    That arm re-runs in place, and the leg below it hands `baseline_commit` /
    `baseline_untracked` to `recovery_flow.rollback_or_pause` — but both were stamped
    from `self.workspace.root`, the UNIT, and the workspace is now the main checkout.

    Neither operand fails loud there. Linked worktrees share the object database, so
    the unit baseline still resolves and a reset onto it succeeds; and a fresh
    worktree is a tracked-only checkout, so its empty `baseline_untracked` makes
    `verify._rollback_cleanup_plan` compute `untracked_files(repo) -
    baseline_untracked` as EVERY untracked file in the operator's own checkout. Under
    an auto-recovering cause those are deleted outright — the operator's own files,
    for a story that merely changed isolation mode.

    Graded on the rollback leg not being entered at all, rather than only on the
    cleared fields: the fields are the mechanism, the un-entered leg is the property.

    The mount's CLAIM and the mount's DIRECTORY are separated, and both are asserted.
    `worktree_path` names a directory and is also how `runs` answers the RETROSPECTIVE
    question — which tree owns the state this task already persisted (`task_spec_root`,
    `task_stories_root`) — so a task that keeps the field set while executing in the
    main checkout makes those readers answer for a tree the run has left. The directory
    itself stays: this arm did not build it, and a policy change is not an instruction
    to delete the operator's tree. The orphan is journaled so that is not silent.

    The PROSPECTIVE readers are deliberately absent from that list and from the
    assertions below. `redrive_base_ref` and `spec_reaches_the_redrive` describe the
    re-drive that has not happened yet, and they take the live isolation mode as a
    parameter rather than inferring it here — because `bmad-loop resolve` asks them in
    a separate process BEFORE this resume runs, where no amount of claim-clearing is
    visible. Asserting them here would grade the argument this test passes them, not
    the field it is about; `test_redrive_base_ref_reads_live_policy_not_the_recorded_mount`
    (tests/test_runs.py) carries that direction against both flips.

    Ablation: narrow the arm back to `release_spec_paths_from_mount()` and this
    reddens on the spy — the leg fires with the unit's operands, which is the state
    that would have deleted them. Separately, drop the `worktree_path = ""` and the
    claim assertions redden while the spy stays green, which is why both are here.

    `unit_branch_name` and the mount path are both DETERMINISTIC in

    mount used. `engine._release_orphaned_mount` deliberately leaves that directory
    standing when live policy drops isolation — a policy change is not an instruction
    to delete the tree — so a later flip BACK re-derives the same path and met a
    `git worktree add` that refuses both an existing target and a branch checked out
    elsewhere, deferring the task instead of resuming it.

    The BRANCH is deliberately spared by the reclaim: under `branch_per=run` this name
    is the SHARED run branch carrying commits earlier units already landed, so a
    force-delete would drop real work. The reclaim drops only the worktree, and the
    `branch_exists` fork re-mounts the branch from its own HEAD — which is what the
    committed file below grades.

    Before #618 an unstaged tracked stray escalated the story and paused an
    unattended run. It should not: a merge writes only paths that differ between
    target and branch, and it commits only what is STAGED, so an edit living solely
    in the working tree can be neither overwritten by the merge nor written into its
    commit. Measured across both topologies and both strategies (#618).

    The history assertion is the half the working tree cannot make. `worktree_clean`
    is False here either way — the operator's edit is still uncommitted, which is the
    point — so "the bytes are still on disk" would pass just as well if a commit had
    also taken a copy of them. Reading every committed version of the path is what
    pins that no commit on the target branch carries the edit.

    tolerated by the row above — but not when it sits on a path the RUN itself
    commits after the merge, and the sprint board is one of those.

    `_carry_board_advance` calls `verify.commit_paths`, which runs
    `git add -- :(literal)<board>` and then a pathspec commit, so it takes whatever
    the working tree holds at that path no matter who wrote it. Left tolerated, the
    operator's private edit rides out under `chore(sprint-status): carry 1-1-a to
    done` — their bytes, the run's name, and a CLEAN tree afterwards, which is
    exactly why nothing surfaces it.

    Reaching that requires the board to be dirty in the main checkout AND outside the
    branch's incoming set, and this row's setup is the shape that produces it rather
    than decoration:

    * the board is committed with the row ALREADY at the target, so the unit
      worktree checks that out, `_post_dev_state_sync`'s advance writes nothing there
      and the board never enters `finalize_commit`'s `git add -A`. It is a stray, not
      an incoming collision — the ordinary tracked board rides the merge instead, and
      a stray inside the incoming set would be restored rather than swept.
    * the operator reopens the row in their own checkout WITHOUT committing, which is
      what `_pick_next` (main board, on disk) reads to pick the story at all, and
      appends a private note beside it.

    The last assertion reads git history, not the working tree, and that is the whole
    point: the measured failure leaves the tree clean and the file's bytes unchanged
    on disk, so "the edit is still there" is true in BOTH the safe and the unsafe

):
    """#619: `merge_local` caught every `verify.GitError` out of `merge_branch` and
    told the operator to resolve "a content conflict against the target". Most of
    those failures are git declining at pre-flight — nothing merged, the checkout
    untouched, no markers anywhere — so the guidance sent them looking for a
    conflict that does not exist. `MergePreflightError` is a GitError subclass, so
    the two arms must be ordered subclass-first for the split to exist at all.

    Each row asserts its own phrase PRESENT and every OTHER row's phrase ABSENT. The
    absence half is the discriminator: a single catch-all arm still makes each row's
    own phrase appear on one of them, and only the cross-check catches the collapse.
    Every other rather than one neighbour, because past two arms a pair can collapse
    into each other while the rest stay distinct.

    `commit-refused` is the third state (#619): git merged cleanly and then declined
    to COMMIT — a `pre-merge-commit`/`commit-msg` hook, or a signing step. Its arm
    exists because neither neighbour's remedy fits it.

    `commit-refused-unrestored` is that state with the abort ALSO failed. It is a
    row and not a footnote because the two differ in what the operator must do
    FIRST: a resume over a mid-merge checkout dies on the merge state however well
    they fix the hook, so a message claiming the checkout was restored costs them
    the one step that unblocks it.

    `commit-refused-staged` is the squash leg's strand of that same state: its
    commit is the leg's own `git commit` after the merge already staged the
    result, so there is no MERGE_HEAD and "recover the merge" would be fiction —
    the squash result is sitting STAGED and clearing it is the first step. The
    `staged` flag is what parts the two unrestored wordings, which is the row's
    whole point.

    `content-conflict` pins the TYPED conflict arm: the conflict is measured
    (unmerged stages) and raised as `MergeConflictError`, so the resolve-by-hand
    wording rides the measurement rather than the absence of a better match.

    `unclassified` pins the demoted catch-all. A bare `GitError` is a state
    nothing measured, and the arm now says so — run `git status`, git's text
    names the cause — instead of prescribing conflict resolution for it. Six
    mislabeled git states in a row reached operators through the old wording;
    this row is what turns a hypothetical seventh into a vague-but-true message
    instead of a precise fiction.

    `half-applied` is the fourth state: git died part-way through the checkout and
    left incoming files behind, untracked. It reaches `merge_local` as a SIBLING of
    the pre-flight error rather than a subclass, so it needs an arm of its own —
    and it is the row the cross-check matters most for, since the phrase it must
    never carry is the pre-flight arm's "the target checkout is unchanged" claim,
    which is false here in the exact clause the operator acts on.

    `residue-unread` is the terminal state: the merge failed and the post-merge
    residue reading failed too, so neither the pre-flight claim (the checkout is
    unchanged) nor the half-applied one (these files were left) is available. Its
    arm says the state is UNVERIFIED and sends the operator to their own
    `git status` — the reading the run could not take. Without the arm it falls
    to the content-conflict catch-all, which is the #619 defect wearing a probe
    error's text.

    Ablation: delete either subclass arm from `merge_local` and its rows fail on
    both halves while the others stay green; collapse the `e.restored` branch to the
    restored wording and only `commit-refused-unrestored` reddens. Every verify-layer
    row stays green throughout, because this is the wiring axis and those are the
    predicate axis."""

    `_close_declared_deferred` writes `self.workspace.paths.deferred_work`, which
    under isolation is the unit worktree's ledger. With the ledger GITIGNORED —
    the default shape, since the ledger lives in the BMAD artifacts dir — the flip
    lands in the worktree, is skipped in silence by `finalize_commit`'s `git add
    -A` (a worktree-scoped exclude shields every seeded rel), brings nothing over
    with the merge, and dies with the worktree at `close_unit_workspace`. Nothing
    in `_carry_isolated_ledger_writes` carries it: that hook owns the harvest and
    the review-budget follow-up, both APPENDS, and a declared close is neither.

    The fixture encodes that false success: the worktree ledger ends `status: done`
    with the resolution annotation, and the journal carries `story-deferred-closed
    dw_ids=['DW-1']` with no `deferred-close-unmatched`. Without the carry the main
    checkout's ledger still reads `status: open` — the run reports a close it never
    delivered. Ablating the seed (`_ledger_seed` -> `()`) puts the pre-seed behavior
    back: the worktree ledger is ABSENT, `classify` reports the id unmatched, and the
    run journals `deferred-close-unmatched dw_ids=['DW-1']`. Louder, equally lost.

    Tracked is the contrast, not a second defect: the sibling above measures the
    same story against a TRACKED ledger and the close rides the unit commit into
    the merge — no seed is made, so no exclude shields it. The fix therefore needs
    no tracked/ignored predicate, only an idempotent carry (re-applying a close
    the merge already delivered is a no-op, exactly as
    `test_tracked_damped_followup_is_not_refiled_twice_by_the_carry` relies on).

    RED here is the last three assertions: the main checkout must end up with the

    taking bytes the run never wrote. `_replay_unlatched_ledger_carries` skips it:
    the re-merge block is guarded on `merged_key not in merged_units`, so a unit whose
    `unit-merged` was already journaled falls straight through to the carry with no
    merge — and therefore no pre-flight — in front of it. The operator's window is the
    crash itself: the host is down, they edit their own checkout, the run comes back.

    `unit-merged` in the crashed run's journal is that leg's precondition and is
    asserted rather than assumed. Without it the resume takes the OTHER branch,
    re-runs the merge, and the pre-flight would have caught the edit after all —
    which is exactly how this row stays disjoint from #618's own witnesses.

    A tracked board's flip rides the merge, so by the time the carry runs it has
    nothing of its own left to write: every byte its commit could take belongs to
    somebody else. That is asserted too, because it is what makes the sweep total
    rather than partial.

    The last assertions read git HISTORY, not the working tree, for the reason
    `_committed_versions` exists: a pathspec carry that swept the edit in leaves the
    tree clean and the file's bytes unchanged on disk, so "the edit is still there"

    `verify_dev` reads that missing file through `story_status`, and

    perfectly and the damage is invisible until run 2 — inside a single run

    `_pick_next`'s own reader, against `ACTIONABLE_STATUSES`, over the file the

    `_git_out`, which returns `stdout.strip()`. A worktree registered at the unit's
    deterministic mount path PLUS a trailing space came back as the bare mount path,
    compared EQUAL to `wt` in `_refuse_foreign_checkout`, and was exempted as if it were
    this unit's own orphan. The ref then moved under a live foreign checkout — files and
    index left at the old tip — its tree went spuriously dirty, and `worktree add` failed

    guard present. The function's own docstring already promised the opposite ("git's

    The error could only ever go that unsafe way. `safe_segment` rstrips `". "` from every

    The shape is produced the same way the two sibling rows above produce a foreign

    keeps its space, it is therefore NOT equal to the mount path, and the remount refuses
    BEFORE any mutation — the branch tip is unchanged and the foreign checkout still
    holds it. Pre-fix a `GitError` still arrived (from `worktree add`), which is why the

    * With that equality assertion ALSO removed, the same ablation still reddens, now on
      `_refuse_foreign_checkout` raising `GitError` over the unit's own mount. So the
      negative half is not vacuous: it fails when the function over-refuses.
