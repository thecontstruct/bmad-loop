    name the path twice: claude's `seed_files` carries `.claude/settings.json`, which

    derivation is a no-op there and the test could not tell the fix from the bug. The
    coincidence #471 reports is the same thing that makes claude useless as a fixture.

    failure now reads as a SUCCESS.

    `_close_declared_deferred` writes `self.workspace.paths.deferred_work`, which
    under isolation is the unit worktree's ledger. With the ledger GITIGNORED —
    the default shape, since the ledger lives in the BMAD artifacts dir — the flip
    lands in the worktree, is skipped in silence by `finalize_commit`'s `git add
    -A` (a worktree-scoped exclude shields every seeded rel), brings nothing over
    with the merge, and dies with the worktree at `close_unit_workspace`. Nothing
    in `_carry_isolated_ledger_writes` carries it: that hook owns the harvest and
    the review-budget follow-up, both APPENDS, and a declared close is neither.

    The fixture encodes that false success: the worktree ledger ends `status: done`
    with the resolution annotation, and the journal carries `story-deferred-closed
    dw_ids=['DW-1']` with no `deferred-close-unmatched`. Without the carry the main
    checkout's ledger still reads `status: open` — the run reports a close it never
    delivered. Ablating the seed (`_ledger_seed` -> `()`) puts the pre-seed behavior
    back: the worktree ledger is ABSENT, `classify` reports the id unmatched, and the
    run journals `deferred-close-unmatched dw_ids=['DW-1']`. Louder, equally lost.

    Tracked is the contrast, not a second defect: the sibling above measures the
    same story against a TRACKED ledger and the close rides the unit commit into
    the merge — no seed is made, so no exclude shields it. The fix therefore needs
    no tracked/ignored predicate, only an idempotent carry (re-applying a close
    the merge already delivered is a no-op, exactly as
    `test_tracked_damped_followup_is_not_refiled_twice_by_the_carry` relies on).

    RED here is the last three assertions: the main checkout must end up with the
    annotation the worktree got. Everything above them holds today and must keep
    holding — the fix delivers the close, it does not stop reporting one.
