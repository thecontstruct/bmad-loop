"""Registry tests for the core `BMAD_LOOP_*` runtime overrides.

`envvars` is the one place each core var is named, typed, and given a reader, so
what is pinned here is the *contract* the call sites (`engine`,
`adapters.multiplexer`, `cli`, `process_host`, `runs`) and the README's
"Environment variables" table both depend on: the literal names, and each
reader's parse and fallback. The two name readers pass their value through
verbatim on purpose — validation lives downstream in the registry that resolves
the name — so a test asserting rejection here would be asserting the wrong
module's job. `state_dir` is verbatim for a related reason (a stated override
must not be silently swapped for a guess) with one exception, the empty string,
which is graded here because `runs.state_root` trusts what this reader returns.

Contract parity: `test_engine.py::test_session_timeout_s_env_override` pins the
same rejection set one layer up, through `Engine._session_timeout_s` (does the
policy default survive a bad override?). This file grades the reader itself
(what does the parse return?), which is why it carries the rows that only a
direct read can distinguish — `nan`, which parses, survives the `<= 0`
comparison, and is rejected only by the finiteness check — and the two name
readers the engine never touches. Deliberately
layered, not duplicated: a behavior change lands in both or records the
divergence.

# The rejection is three independent gates, and every row below is held by exactly
# one of them — grade them singly, since ablating them together reddens every row
# at once and so grades none of them:
#   (a) the `try/except ValueError` holds the unparseable rows, which would
#       otherwise raise out of the reader instead of reading as None;
#   (b) the `value <= 0` half holds the zero and negative rows;
#   (c) the `not math.isfinite(value)` half holds the non-finite spellings — and
#       `nan`.
# ⚠️ (c) holding `nan` is load-bearing and easy to get backwards. Under the old
# `return value if value > 0 else None`, nan was rejected by the COMPARISON (every
# comparison against nan is False). The guard is now spelled `value <= 0`, and
# `nan <= 0` is ALSO False — so nan no longer falls out of the comparison and the
# finiteness check holds it alone. Same result, different gate: do not "simplify"
# (c) away on the theory that `> 0` already covers nan, because this form does not.
# The [inf]/[1e999]/[Infinity]/[INF] rows are why (c) exists at all: `float()`
# accepts all four and each passes a bare `> 0`, so before it they read as a real
# budget and the deadline the adapters compute from it (`time.monotonic() +
