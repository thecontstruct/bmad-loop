    stops *itself* off the control file, and stop_run confirms rather than blindly

    The child ignores SIGTERM, modelling a native-Windows engine — which never
    receives an inter-process SIGTERM at all, and whose `taskkill` "graceful" step
    posts a WM_CLOSE that a console process has no window to receive. So the only
    channel that can reach it is the `mode: hard` request stop_run lodges before
    signalling. It polls for that file, marks the run stopped exactly as the
    engine's own handler does, and exits 0. Before #319 this was unreachable: every
    Windows stop burned the full grace window into a blind force-kill and `stopped`
    was written by the external fallback, so the engine-is-single-writer invariant
    held only by fallback.

    The reaper thread clears the exited child so the liveness probe stops reading it
    as alive: `os.kill(pid, 0)` answers True for an unreaped zombie, and this test
    holds the Popen handle. Production never has that problem — the engine is not
    the CLI's child — so without the reaper the assertions below would still pass
    but take the whole (shortened) wait window, hiding the speed this fixes.

    """A hard request landing anywhere inside the check -> write window is not
    downgraded, and the guarantee holds at the *last* instant, not just an early one.

    `request_graceful_stop` clears its existence check, then spends a pid-file read
    and a liveness probe before it lodges — measured at ~1.3ms median on btrfs back
    when an fsync sat in there too. The channel is last-writer-wins, so an
    unconditional write here silently supersedes the stronger stop and costs the
    operator the abort they asked for. `O_CREAT | O_EXCL` fuses the decision to the
    write so no interleaving can land between them.

    The two parameters are the point. `engine_liveness` lodges early — a re-read
    immediately before the write already catches that one. `just_before_the_create`
    lodges from the last statement that runs ahead of the `os.open`, which only real
    arbitration catches; a re-read narrows that window but cannot close it.

    Only this direction can lose anything — the mode lattice is monotone (graceful
    refuses to overwrite, hard only ever writes hard), so a stale "hard" read is
    still true while a stale "graceful" may not be.

    ⚠️ Re-reading the mode just before the unlink does NOT fix this and measurably

    `_create_stop_request` creates the file with `O_EXCL` and then writes the body
    into it, so a failed write once rolled back with `path.unlink()`. `unlink`
    resolves the *name*, not the inode this call created — so a `stop` escalating to
    `mode: "hard"` onto that name while the write was in flight was deleted by the
    cleanup of a graceful lodge that never completed. That is a `hard -> absent`
    drop, below both rungs of the lattice, and on native Windows it withdraws the
    only channel that can stop the engine while `stop_run` still reports the request
    lodged.

    Closed by subtraction: there is no rollback. A short or empty body reads as
    "graceful", which is the mode this call was asked to lodge anyway.

    ⚠️ Guarding the unlink instead does NOT fix this and measurably worsens it, the

    narrowing it (inode compare 1.39x, mode compare 2.30x worse over a

    symlinked directory, so a link planted at either survived the setup step and
    aimed the stamp wherever it pointed.

    The confinement root is the STATE ROOT, not the digest's parent: the walk
    covers the components strictly below the root, so rooting this at
    `path.parent` would check neither of the two components a session could reach
    and this row would stay green with the escape open. It is also not the
    project — this record deliberately lives OUT of the tree the baseline exists
    to police (`test_config_digest_is_stamped_under_the_state_root_not_in_the_project`).

    The mkdir runs first and walks THROUGH the planted link, so an empty `r1/`
    legitimately appears outside; what must not appear is content. That is what the
    last assertion says.

    Ablation: revert the call to
    `atomic_write_text(path, digest + chr(10), follow_symlinks=False)` and this

    reading its own pid file to make the call.

    Nothing in the fixture marks the session as foreign, because nothing can: that is
    the defect. Foreignness is constructed out of band — `theirs` created the session
    (untagged, because its tag write failed or it predates a working one) and is still
    running it, while `ours` only shares the id. Both views are asserted, so the test
    shows the two projects disagreeing about one live session rather than just echoing
    one side.

    The collision needs no luck: `--run-id` is accepted from the CLI and validated for
    shape only, so a script reusing one fixed id across two projects reproduces it.

    Pinned as the actual outcome, not the desired one. #523's digest keeps ordinary

    and has no `ProjectPaths` to consult, so the surfaces that re-arm BEFORE they resume

    different questions:

    - `moved` — a `repo_root:` edit while the run was paused. The mirror follows, and the
      operator is told, because every sha the run already recorded names an object in the
      previous tree and nothing here can move them.
    - `unchanged` — the ordinary re-arm. No message, and no write at all: a row that
      rewrote state.json on every re-arm would make the "durable before the engine
      starts" ordering above it meaningless to reason about.
    - `legacy` — a state.json written before the field existed reads back `""`. That is a
      MISSING value, not a divergent one: it migrates silently, and calling it a move
      would fire the warning once on every pre-upgrade run.

    The journal line is graded on the same three rows, because it is the DURABLE half
    and the return value is not: the caller prints that string to stderr or a TUI toast
    and it is gone. Worse, this re-stamp is what makes `cli._resume_paused_run`'s own
    `code_root_changed` record read `false` later in the same gesture — both sides read
    `bmadconfig.load_paths` on one project, so once the mirror is aimed the compare
    NECESSARILY agrees. Without this line the one gesture where the root actually moved
    is the one that leaves no trace, while plain `resume` still writes one.

    Ablation: `legacy` returns `None` at the `if not state.code_root_restamp_pending:
    return None` guard — the marker reads False because `moved` is
    `bool(state.repo_root)` and the recorded root was empty — so widen `moved` to a
    bare `True` and `legacy` reddens on the message, while `unchanged` still exits
    above at "already agrees"; return the message without the `save_state` and `moved`
    reddens on the persisted root while the other two rows still pass; delete the

    root from `task_spec_root` — the RECORDED project spelling, which nothing re-stamps.
    The three writes it undoes (the status flip, the `## Auto Run Result` strip and the

    why every pre-existing `_restore_rearmed_spec` row stayed green either way: they all
    call `rearm_escalation` WITHOUT `project_root`, so the whole dimension was uncovered.
    Rename the project and they diverge — the live path is not under the recorded root,
    the predicate goes False, and the undo takes the UNCONFINED arm on exactly the spec
    its siblings just wrote through the confined one.

    Nothing downstream can see that: the right file gets the right bytes and the record

    `test_live_spec_root_still_confines_the_live_spec_path` grades the forward half.

    The spies go on the `runs` namespace because that is where the call site reads them:
    `runs` binds both writers with `from .platform_util import ...`, so patching here
    reaches `_restore_rearmed_spec` and CANNOT reach the forward writers, which hold
    their own bindings in `verify`, `frontmatter` and `devcontract`. The recorded call
    list is therefore the undo's alone.

    Swallowing that interrupt costs nothing the operator asked for. The rollback is a
    repair write whose omission IS the defect, and the guard's `raise` still propagates
    the original `MemoryError` a spec-sized write later — which the last assertion pins.

    BOTH rows matter and they grade different halves. `OSError` (a corrupt or unreadable
    state file) passes under either breadth. `KeyboardInterrupt` is the one that grades
    the WIDTH.

    Ablation: narrow the probe's catch back to `except Exception` and the
    `KeyboardInterrupt` row reddens — the spec comes back flipped and no abort record
    exists — while the `OSError` row stays green, which is exactly why one row alone is
    no oracle.

    out-of-mount arm falls back to the project precisely so a `confine_root` can never
    fail to contain the anchored path. The stories FOLDER is a different question: it is
    located from the workspace root by `state.spec_folder`, and a task's spec being
    elsewhere says nothing about where its manifest lives. `stories_engine._stories_folder`
    answers the mount for this task, so borrowing the confinement answer made one surface
    describe two trees.

    Every other row builds the isolated shape with a RELATIVE `spec_file`, where the two
    resolvers agree by construction and cannot tell each other apart — which is why
    collapsing `task_stories_root` back into `task_spec_root` left the whole suite green.

    Ablation: make `task_stories_root` delegate to `task_spec_root` and this reddens on
    the first assertion; the second pins that the two genuinely diverge here, so a future
    change that made them agree could not satisfy both."""
