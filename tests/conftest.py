#

# through a dead window rather than a hook event; the descendant-reap poll deadlines
# in `tests/test_stories_e2e.py` (DW-108), which wait on a killed child disappearing
# rather than on any session event; and the detached-fake readiness gate (DW-159) that
# both `setsid` fakes in that module splice between `child=$!` and publication, which
# waits inside bash on the child's own setsid(2) transition completing.
#
# This is a HANG DETECTOR, not a performance budget: it answers "is this session
# wedged?" and nothing else. It is deliberately NOT tuned to observed runtimes — never
# lower it to make a slow test loud, and never read a passing run as evidence about
# how fast the work is.
#
# Sized from both ends. Floor: the waits measure ~1.0s locally and 3.4-4.2s on the CI
# runner, and the worst starvation ever observed was 30.14s, so 90s is ~21x the CI
# work and ~3x that starvation — far outside anything the scheduler can do to it.
# Ceiling: `--dist loadgroup` now serializes every one of these onto ONE worker, so a
# SYSTEMIC regression pays the wait once per test rather than in parallel, and the
# Linux test job is capped at `timeout-minutes: 15` — 900s (.github/workflows/ci.yml).
# Eleven sites (five hook-completion cases, one crash case, the three stories reap polls,
# and the readiness gate in each of the two detached fakes) nominally total 990s for
# these waits alone — sites, not collected instances: several sit in parametrized rows.
# The two gate sites cannot actually add their 180s on top: each is bounded from OUTSIDE
# by the `_run(..., timeout=120)` wall its row runs under. The gate usually fires first;
# the outer wall wins only when earlier work has used enough of that shared budget. The
# stories subprocess budgets (`_run(..., timeout=90/120)`) and other overhead sit
# OUTSIDE this constant and are additional, so this ceiling does not guarantee the whole
# job fits within its cap.

    ``TMUX``/``TMUX_PANE`` go with it, for the developer half of the same problem:
    a multiplexer sets them on every pane child, so running the suite from inside

    """The MONOREPO shape of the override: `repo_root` an ANCESTOR of `project`.

    The BMAD project lives at ``<repo>/app`` inside a checkout whose root is the
    git root. The helper writes the same config shape production loads, then
    returns :func:`load_paths`' canonical snapshot rather than hand-building one.

    Why a second shape at all. `tests/test_verify.py::_repo_root_override` builds
    the SIBLING shape, where the artifact tree is disjoint from the code tree — so
    a code-root spelling collapses to ``()`` while a project-root spelling is a
    non-empty tail that matches nothing in the code tree. Both spellings therefore
    agree on the gate outcome and a wrong-but-plausible pathspec passes unnoticed.
    Nested, the wrong pathspec is not empty: resolved
    against the code root, ``_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/spec-1-1-a.md``
    names the OUTER project's real artifact dir. That is the "not merely wrong, it
    is SILENTLY wrong" failure the production docstrings describe, and it is
    separable by VALUE.

    Seeds and COMMITS ``app/src.txt`` so `dev_effect` works unchanged — it
    reads `paths.project / "src.txt"` and `rev_parse_head(paths.project)`, and git
    resolves `.git` upward from the subdir. Committed rather than left untracked
    for the reason `plant_root_markers` gives: a session's edit to a TRACKED file
    is proof of work the attempt's baseline snapshot cannot absorb.

    Also writes ``app/.gitignore`` with all four entries `bmad-loop init` owns.
    Init writes that file next to the project it initializes, and the sandbox
    template's root-anchored entries do not match nested state — so without the
    nested file run state, caches, policy, and renderer output can show up as
    untracked work.

    The subdirectory is FIXED at `NESTED_SUBDIR` rather than a parameter because
    every consumer's assertions spell the ``app/`` prefix literally. A parameter
    would make a non-default argument redden those rows on a prefix mismatch instead
    of on the contract they grade.

    Refuses input it cannot honor. It commits unconditionally, so a second call on
    the same `paths` (or one whose subdir a caller pre-created) dies inside `git`
    with a raw ``CalledProcessError`` from ``git commit`` — "nothing to commit" —
    naming neither the helper nor the precondition. Both guards below fail with
    the precondition instead.

def seed_outer_decoy_ledger(paths: ProjectPaths) -> tuple[Path, bytes]:
    """Seed the OUTER project's decoy ledger under `nested_repo_root_paths`' shape.

    The companion half of `nested_repo_root_paths`. Under the nested shape the
    ledger's project-relative tail (``_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/
    deferred-work.md``) re-rooted at `repo_root` is *precisely* the real file a
    `project`-rooted pathspec silently names once git resolves it in the code tree
    — the "not merely wrong, it is SILENTLY wrong" failure the consumer rows grade.
    So the decoy is DERIVED from `paths.deferred_work`, never re-spelled: the
    helper's derivation and `engine._harvest_gate_exclude`'s rule move together if
    the artifact layout ever changes.

    Returns ``(path, bytes)`` rather than bare bytes because every consumer needs
    the path too — for `is_file`/`resolve` claims and for its own `git add` seed
    list — and a bytes-only return would leave each row re-deriving the identity by
    hand, which is the duplication this helper exists to remove.

    SEEDS ONLY: it writes the file and stops — it never stages, commits, or touches
    the decoy again. The consumer rows turn on the decoy being left ALONE afterwards,
    and whether it ends up tracked is each row's own premise to establish and to
    pin, not something this helper may decide on their behalf.

    The content is fixed and the path always derives from `paths`; neither is an
    additional helper argument. Consumers share that seed while the decoy's location
    follows the artifact layout.

    Refuses input it cannot honor, and BOTH refused shapes fail silently rather than
    loudly — which is why they are asserted rather than left to fall over on their
    own. On COLLAPSED paths (``project == repo_root``, the plain `project` fixture)
    the "decoy" would BE `paths.deferred_work`, so the helper would overwrite the
    very ledger the consumer rows exclude. On DISJOINT paths (`repo_root` not an
    ancestor of `project`, the sibling shape) nothing raises either: both operands of
    ``paths.deferred_work.relative_to(paths.project)`` are independent of `repo_root`,
    so the tail still resolves and the helper would happily seed a file into a tree
    that has no outer project at all — a decoy no pathspec spelling can name, making
    the consumer's claim vacuous instead of false. A decoy already on disk is refused
    rather than overwritten: the consumer rows create it deliberately so the claim is
    graded by value, and silently absorbing an inherited one would turn that premise
    into a setup accident. All three guards fail before anything is written.

    """Make ``Path.resolve()`` fail for exactly ``targets``.

    By DEFAULT it raises WinError 64 — the answer a registered-but-not-serving WSL UNC
    provider gives (#529/#536), and one CPython's non-strict ``ntpath`` allow-list does
    not absorb, so ``resolve()`` fails outright instead of degrading to its own lexical
    walk. That is the #552 condition, and it is what every call site written before
    DW-195 means; the keyword is optional precisely so none of them had to be edited.

    ``error`` supplies a DIFFERENT resolve fault instead. A resolve can fail in more than
    one exception class — POSIX ``Path.resolve()`` raises ``RuntimeError`` on a symlink
    loop, not ``OSError`` — and a caller grading a handler that catches several classes
    needs to drive each class separately. Passing the exception here rather than
    hand-rolling a second local ``Path.resolve`` stub keeps one shared fault seam: a
    private stub beside this helper is the hand-rolled duplicate these conversions remove.

    ``Exception``, not ``BaseException``: no production handler catches
    ``KeyboardInterrupt``/``SystemExit``/``GeneratorExit``, so a per-class ablation driven
    with one of those would be vacuous by construction — the arm under test could be
    deleted and the row would still red.

    The exception is RE-CONSTRUCTED from its class and args on every matching resolve
    rather than re-raised as one object. With ~43 call sites this is a shared seam, and a
    consumer that resolves the same target twice would otherwise accumulate
    ``__traceback__`` frames and ``__context__`` chaining on a single instance, so the
    second fault would carry the first one's frames. The class must therefore accept its
    own ``args`` back, which every plain ``Exception(message)`` does.

    Scoped to named paths on purpose: a blanket stub would break every unrelated
    resolve in the process, and a row asserting "the command survived" would then pass
    for a reason that has nothing to do with the guard under test. Also clears the
    one-note-per-process dedupe set, so a row can assert on a note a previous test in

    """Make exactly ``target``'s ``probe`` metadata call raise PermissionError; every
    other path still answers normally, and so does every other probe on ``target`` —
    with the ``stat`` family the documented exception, see its own paragraph below.

    ``error`` supplies a DIFFERENT fault instead, on the same terms as
    ``refuse_to_resolve(..., error=)``: RE-CONSTRUCTED from its class and args on
    every matching probe rather than re-raised as one object, so a consumer probing
    the target twice does not see the first raise's frames on the second. Its use
    is the ``ValueError`` family ``Path.stat`` raises for a path the OS cannot
    encode (:data:`NUL_PATH_RESOLVE_FAULTS`), which no ``PermissionError`` row can
    reach and no ``except OSError`` catches.

    ``probe`` is one of ``exists`` / ``is_file`` / ``is_symlink`` / ``stat`` /
    ``lstat`` — one probe at a time, which does NOT make one guard-per-probe
    ablatable: a caller may well take several inside a single ``try``, where one
    ``except`` covers the lot. What it buys is coverage of each ENTRY PATH into
    that one guard — each probe is reached only after the ones before it answered
    a particular way, so a row per probe proves every reachable arm is inside the
    guard rather than only the first.

    Selective monkeypatching rather than chmod, and here that is not merely the
    ``fault_read_text`` convention: chmod is a no-op for root, carries no read bit
    on Windows, and since Python 3.14 ``Path.is_file()`` suppresses OS errors
    internally, so a permission bit cannot raise out of that probe on Python 3.14.

    The point of the fault is that on Python 3.11–3.13 these calls do NOT swallow
    everything: they absorb only ``pathlib``'s ignored errnos
    (``ENOENT``/``ENOTDIR``/``EBADF``/``ELOOP``) and raise the rest, so ``EACCES``
    is a real answer a caller must handle.
    Python 3.14 suppresses all OS errors in them, so this helper INJECTS on every
    version the fault only the older ones raise on their own — which is the point:
    the handler under grade must exist for the versions that can reach it.

    ``stat`` and ``lstat`` are the exception to that whole paragraph, and ``stat``
    is why DW-221 moved the repair/write ledger reader onto it: neither suppresses
    ANYTHING on any interpreter — CPython's pathlib docs name ``stat`` as the probe
    that reports the error rather than answering False, which is exactly what
    ``is_file()`` stopped doing in 3.14 when its body became ``os.path.isfile``, and
    ``lstat`` is the same call declining to follow the last component. So a fault
    injected on either is not a simulation of an older runtime the way the other
    three are; it is the fault a real EACCES parent directory produces on 3.11
    through 3.14 alike. DW-239 moved ``verify.commit_paths``' presence probe onto
    ``lstat`` for exactly that reason, which is what makes that probe ablatable
    here at all — on ``exists``/``is_symlink`` a 3.14 run could not reach the
    handler under grade.

    On Python 3.11–3.13, ``exists()``, ``is_file()`` and ``is_dir()`` call
    ``self.stat()``, so this injection can affect sibling probes too. Their
    default Python 3.14 implementations instead delegate to ``os.path`` and
    bypass a ``Path.stat`` monkeypatch. A test simulating 3.14 suppression on an
    older interpreter must also pin ``Path.is_file`` to return ``False``; see
    ``test_read_for_write_propagates_a_refused_metadata_probe``."""

    same key — a reader that only knows `baseline_commit` must fail a test here,
    not sail through production (issue #89).

    ``legacy_baseline`` adds the OTHER key, and exists because until #716 this
    fixture *could not express the bug*: a spec that carries both is exactly what
    `runs.rearm_escalation` manufactures (it inserts `baseline_revision` and never
    removes a pre-existing `baseline_commit`), and no fixture could produce one, so
    the precedence between them was untestable. ``OMIT`` writes no key at all
    (the default, and what every pre-existing caller gets — `tests/test_verify.py`
    asserts on that absence). ``None`` writes a bare ``baseline_commit:`` line, the
    YAML-null shape. Any other value is written as a quoted scalar, including ``""``
    for the empty-value shape that a ``dict.get(k, default)`` chain selects but a

    is then absent and `baseline_commit` is the only claim on the file.

    was made in.

    ``operator_actions`` writes the park declaration (#335) as a real YAML BLOCK
    sequence — the shape the dev prompt asks a session for, and the shape a human
    reads back — so the reading under test is the one production sees. A non-list
    renders as a scalar, which is the wrong-container mistake for this field
    too (a bare string is iterable, so a lenient reader would turn one
    instruction into a list of characters).

    ``deferred`` adds the post-#2640 frontmatter list using

    baseline snapshot refresh actually runs and `baseline_commit` defaults to HEAD.
    That refresh reads `state.code_root`, not `state.project`; the two name the same

    non-repo project must not fail re-arm) but journals as
    `rearm-baseline-advance-failed` while the old baseline stands — degraded and
