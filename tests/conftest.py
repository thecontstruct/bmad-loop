    The BMAD project lives at ``<repo>/app`` inside a checkout whose root is the
    git root — `repo_root` stays `paths.project` (the sandbox repo) while
    `project` and all three artifact dirs move under ``app/``.

    Why a second shape at all. `tests/test_verify.py::_repo_root_override` builds
    the SIBLING shape, where the artifact tree is disjoint from the code tree — so
    a code-root spelling collapses to ``()`` while a project-root spelling is a
    non-empty tail that matches nothing in the code tree. Both spellings therefore
    agree on the gate outcome and a wrong-but-plausible pathspec passes unnoticed.
    Nested, the wrong pathspec is not empty: resolved
    against the code root, ``_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/spec-1-1-a.md``
    names the OUTER project's real artifact dir. That is the "not merely wrong, it
    is SILENTLY wrong" failure the production docstrings describe, and it is
    separable by VALUE.

    Seeds and COMMITS ``app/src.txt`` so `dev_effect` works unchanged — it
    reads `paths.project / "src.txt"` and `rev_parse_head(paths.project)`, and git
    resolves `.git` upward from the subdir. Committed rather than left untracked
    for the reason `plant_root_markers` gives: a session's edit to a TRACKED file
    is proof of work the attempt's baseline snapshot cannot absorb.

    Also writes ``app/.gitignore`` with the `bmad-loop init` run-state entry.
    Init writes that file next to the project it initializes, and the sandbox
    template's own root-anchored ``.bmad-loop/runs/`` does not match a nested one —
    so without it a nested engine run's journal would show up as untracked work.

    The subdirectory is FIXED at `NESTED_SUBDIR` rather than a parameter because
    every consumer's assertions spell the ``app/`` prefix literally. A parameter
    would make a non-default argument redden those rows on a prefix mismatch instead
    of on the contract they grade.

    Refuses input it cannot honor. It commits unconditionally, so a second call on
    the same `paths` (or one whose subdir a caller pre-created) dies inside `git`
    with a raw ``CalledProcessError`` from ``git commit`` — "nothing to commit" —

    ``baseline`` accepts ``OMIT`` too, for the legacy-only spec: `baseline_revision`
    is then absent and `baseline_commit` is the only claim on the file.

    ``closes_deferred`` writes the story-declared ledger-closure field (#234): a
    list renders as a YAML flow sequence, and a bare string renders as a scalar —
    the wrong-container mistake whose handling must not depend on which file it
    was made in.

    ``operator_actions`` writes the park declaration (#335) as a real YAML BLOCK
    sequence — the shape the dev prompt asks a session for, and the shape a human
    reads back — so the reading under test is the one production sees. A non-list
    renders as a scalar, which is the wrong-container mistake for this field
    too (a bare string is iterable, so a lenient reader would turn one
    instruction into a list of characters).

    ``deferred`` adds the post-#2640 frontmatter list using
    :func:`render_deferred`. ``None`` omits the field entirely (the pre-#2640
    shape); ``[]`` emits an explicit empty list. It is rendered last so adding
    this fixture capability does not reorder either pre-existing declaration.

    the shared shape behind test_runs / test_resolve / test_cli, whose three local
    copies had drifted into different defaults, different return tuples, and one
    unique kwarg each. Parameterized as a superset rather than lowest-common-
    denominator: every field a caller relied on is still reachable, so no test's
    fixture-specific assertion is weakened by the dedup.

    ``with_session`` appends the completed review SessionRecord the resolve-context
    builder reads. ``git_project`` makes ``state.project`` a REAL repo (spec files
    already written are committed, run state is gitignored) so `rearm_escalation`'s
    baseline snapshot refresh actually runs and `baseline_commit` defaults to HEAD.
    That refresh reads `state.code_root`, not `state.project`; the two name the same
    directory for this fixture only because the RunState below records no
    `repo_root`, and `code_root` is defined as `repo_root or project` — a caller that
    ever adds an override must git-init THAT tree, not this one. In a bare tmp_path
    the refresh's git calls raise `verify.GitError`, which re-arm swallows (a
    non-repo project must not fail re-arm) but journals as
    `rearm-baseline-advance-failed` while the old baseline stands — degraded and
    visible, not silent, so a test asserting the advance must pass ``git_project``
    rather than read a no-op as success.
