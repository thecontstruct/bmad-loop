    choice as `follow_symlinks=False`: since #593 `_atomic_write_spec` routes it to
    `atomic_write_bytes_confined`, which is no-follow by construction. The
    out-of-tree arm keeps the plain no-follow write — the chokepoint rows below

    Behaviour-preserving, not a tightening: the `atomic_replace` this replaced never
