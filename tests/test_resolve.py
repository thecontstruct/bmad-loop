    """`context.json` names the spec in the tree the RUN owns, absolute.

    `StoryTask._serialized_worktree_path` persists an isolated unit's `spec_file`
    RELATIVE to the mounted worktree and `from_dict` reads it back raw, so the raw
    value handed to the agent was a bare relpath. The `bmad-loop-resolve` session runs
    from the PROJECT root, where the main checkout carries the very same
    `_bmad-output/specs/...` layout — so that relpath resolved, silently, onto the
    main checkout's twin, and the human and the agent edited a spec the run never used
    while `rearm_escalation` (which re-anchors through `task_spec_path`) flipped the
    worktree's. `build_context` now emits the same re-anchor the re-arm writes
    through, which is also the absolute shape `bmad-loop-resolve/SKILL.md` documents.

    The EQUALITY is what grades this row, and it is the whole instrument:
    `is_absolute()` alone is satisfied by a PROJECT-anchored resolve, which is the
    same bug wearing an absolute path. Two things here are deliberately NOT load-
    bearing, so nobody reads them as proof they are not: `build_context` never opens
    the spec, so both on-disk copies are inert scenery, and the `chdir` cannot change
    an emitted value computed by pure path arithmetic. They are kept because a future
    `abspath`/`resolve()`-shaped resolver WOULD consult the cwd, and pinning it to
    the tree the agent really runs from keeps this row honest under that change.

    Shape, not just value: `.as_posix()` matches `resolution_path`'s contract two
    fields below — one string on every OS — so the assertion compares posix
    spellings and re-uses that field's no-backslash check. `str()` here would have
    regressed Windows, where the value it replaced was already posix
    (`_serialized_worktree_path` persists the relative form with `.as_posix()`).
    Both halves of that check are INERT on POSIX, where `str()` and `.as_posix()`
    agree — exactly as the sibling `resolution_path` assertion is. Windows CI is
    where they grade; do not read a green run here as having exercised them.

    Ablation: revert `build_context`'s field to `task.spec_file if task else None` and
    this reddens on `is_absolute()` — the emitted value is the bare relpath.

    """`verify.set_frontmatter_status` answers "nothing to change" with `False`, never

    status, routed the session to "ingest as context, do not resume", and the story
    re-wedged with nothing on the record explaining why. The `FrontmatterWriteError`
    arm below it covers only the shapes that RAISE; this covers the ones that lie
    quietly.

    `False` has FOUR causes, not three — no file, no frontmatter block, no top-level
    `status:`, and ALREADY AT THE TARGET — and only the first three are failures. Three
    legs, so the record is graded on the distinction rather than on the bool:

    - `no-frontmatter` — a spec that EXISTS and is readable but carries no `---` block:
      the writer returns False and leaves the file byte-identical, so the record is the
      ONLY thing that distinguishes this from a flip that landed. It also ABORTS, because
      the spec IS a readable file here: the routing status is what the re-drive runs on,
      and step-01's contract for a spec without one is not a maybe — it HALTs blocked on
      `unrecognized status in existing story file`. So the re-arm refuses instead of
      burning the escalation on a session that cannot route, and the run is left exactly
      as it was found: the task still ESCALATED (nothing is persisted before this point),
      and the spec byte-identical down to the `## Auto Run Result` section, whose strip is
      sequenced after the check. The other half of that split — a spec that is NOT a file
      from here, where the flip's failure says nothing about what the re-drive will read
      — is graded by `test_rearm_journals_a_skip_when_the_recorded_spec_is_not_readable`.
    - `ordinary` — the control. A spec that really moves must not produce the record, or
      the row would pass for a guard that fires on everything.
    - `already-at-target` — the REGRESSION leg. A second re-arm, or
      `resolve --no-interactive` after a human fixed the spec, hits a spec already at
      `ready-for-dev`. The writer returns False and the operator used to be warned the
      spec "could not be re-opened" and might re-wedge, while the file was correct. It
      must NOT abort either — this is the ordinary flow, and refusing it would wedge
      every second resolve cycle.

    Ablation: delete the `if not flipped ...` arm and the `no-frontmatter` leg reddens
    on `DID NOT RAISE` while both other legs still pass. Drop the
    `status_of(read_frontmatter(...)) != target` conjunct and `already-at-target`
    reddens alone, now on that same raise — which is the discrimination this row exists
    for, and the leg that shows why the abort had to be narrowed to the same conjunct
    the record is. Delete the `raise RearmError(...)` and keep the append and the
    no-frontmatter leg reddens on `DID NOT RAISE` while its record assertions still

    not reach here. That arm guards BOTH spec helpers, and `strip_auto_run_result` is the
    later one: ordering the strip after the check protects the CHECK, but a fault raised
    inside the strip itself is raised with the status flip already published and

    record carries a discriminator rather than leaving the reader to guess.

    Setup is a `worktree` -> `none` flip: the task still carries the escalated
    attempt's mount (nothing clears it until the resume runs `_finish_inflight`), so
    `task_spec_path` anchors the re-arm's status flip inside that mount — while
    `_run_story` will re-run the story in the main checkout, which never reads it. The
    write is unreachable, exactly as under isolation, and for the opposite reason.

    So the remedy inverts. Under isolation the correction must be COMMITTED, because
    the replacement worktree is cut from git and reads no working tree. Here the
    re-drive reads the main checkout's WORKING tree, so the correction has to be
    re-applied there and a commit is beside the point — and naming `target_branch`
    would send the operator to the one place this re-drive does not look. Both fields
    move: `redrive` says which shape it is, and `target_branch` goes empty.

    `rearm_event_notice` renders out of process from the journal line alone, so it
    cannot re-read the policy that produced the record; the discriminator has to be ON
    the line or the reader falls back to the isolated wording it cannot verify.

    `unrecognized status in existing story file` and the escalation is spent. Its
