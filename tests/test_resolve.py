    `StoryTask._serialized_worktree_path` persists an isolated unit's `spec_file`

    value handed to the agent was a bare relpath. The `bmad-loop-resolve` session runs
    from the PROJECT root, where the main checkout carries the same
    implementation-artifacts-relative path — so that relpath resolved, silently, onto the
    main checkout's twin, and the human and the agent edited a spec the run never used
    while `rearm_escalation` (which re-anchors through `task_spec_path`) flipped the
    worktree's. `build_context` now emits the same re-anchor the re-arm writes
    through, which is also the absolute shape `bmad-loop-resolve/SKILL.md` documents.

    The EQUALITY is what grades this row, and it is the whole instrument:
    `is_absolute()` alone is satisfied by a PROJECT-anchored resolve, which is the
    same bug wearing an absolute path. Two things here are deliberately NOT load-
    bearing, so nobody reads them as proof they are not: `build_context` never opens
    the spec, so both on-disk copies are inert scenery, and the `chdir` cannot change
    an emitted value computed by pure path arithmetic. They are kept because a future
    `abspath`/`resolve()`-shaped resolver WOULD consult the cwd, and pinning it to
    the tree the agent really runs from keeps this row honest under that change.

    Shape, not just value: `.as_posix()` matches `resolution_path`'s contract two
    fields below — one string on every OS — so the assertion compares posix
    spellings and re-uses that field's no-backslash check. `str()` here would have
    regressed Windows, where the value it replaced was already posix
    (`_serialized_worktree_path` persists the relative form with `.as_posix()`).
    Both halves of that check are INERT on POSIX, where `str()` and `.as_posix()`
    agree — exactly as the sibling `resolution_path` assertion is. Windows CI is
    where they grade; do not read a green run here as having exercised them.

    """`verify.set_frontmatter_status` answers "nothing to change" with `False`, never
    an exception. Its return was DISCARDED, so on such a spec the flip no-opped
    invisibly: the re-drive was dispatched anyway, step-01 read the unchanged terminal
    status, routed the session to "ingest as context, do not resume", and the story
    re-wedged with nothing on the record explaining why. The `FrontmatterWriteError`
    arm below it covers only the shapes that RAISE; this covers the ones that lie
    quietly.

    `False` has FOUR causes, not three — no file, no frontmatter block, no top-level
    `status:`, and ALREADY AT THE TARGET — and only the first three are failures. Three
    legs, so the record is graded on the distinction rather than on the bool:

    - `no-frontmatter` — a spec that EXISTS and is readable but carries no `---` block:
      the writer returns False and leaves the file byte-identical, so the record is the
      ONLY thing that distinguishes this from a flip that landed. It also ABORTS, because
      the spec IS a readable file here: the routing status is what the re-drive runs on,
      and step-01's contract for a spec without one is not a maybe — it HALTs blocked on
      `unrecognized status in existing story file`. So the re-arm refuses instead of
      burning the escalation on a session that cannot route, and the run is left exactly
      as it was found: the task still ESCALATED (nothing is persisted before this point),
      and the spec byte-identical down to the `## Auto Run Result` section, whose strip is
      sequenced after the check. The other half of that split — a spec that is NOT a file
      from here, where the flip's failure says nothing about what the re-drive will read
      — is graded by `test_rearm_journals_a_skip_when_the_recorded_spec_is_not_readable`.
    - `ordinary` — the control. A spec that really moves must not produce the record, or
      the row would pass for a guard that fires on everything.
    - `already-at-target` — the REGRESSION leg. A second re-arm, or
      `resolve --no-interactive` after a human fixed the spec, hits a spec already at
      `ready-for-dev`. The writer returns False and the operator used to be warned the
      spec "could not be re-opened" and might re-wedge, while the file was correct. It
      must NOT abort either — this is the ordinary flow, and refusing it would wedge
      every second resolve cycle.

    Ablation: delete the `if not flipped ...` arm and the `no-frontmatter` leg reddens
    on `DID NOT RAISE` while both other legs still pass. Drop the
    `status_of(read_frontmatter(...)) != target` conjunct and `already-at-target`
    reddens alone, now on that same raise — which is the discrimination this row exists
    for, and the leg that shows why the abort had to be narrowed to the same conjunct
    the record is. Delete the `raise RearmError(...)` and keep the append and the
    no-frontmatter leg reddens on `DID NOT RAISE` while its record assertions still
    pass — the record is not the refusal. Move `strip_auto_run_result` back above the
    check and the byte-identity assertion reddens alone.

    `StoryTask` persists `spec_file` relative to a worktree
    (`model._serialized_worktree_path`) and `from_dict` reads it back raw, so a
    re-arm of a task that ran under isolation can hold a path that resolves against
    nothing from this process's cwd. Every writer in the spec block answers that
    with `False` rather than an exception — `set_frontmatter_status`,
    `strip_auto_run_result` and `set_frontmatter_field` all guard on `is_file` — and
    all three return values are dropped, so without this guard the status flip AND
    the baseline re-stamp both do nothing and the spec keeps the escalated attempt's
    sha with no record anywhere.

    It is also the NEGATIVE control for the flip abort one screen above it. A spec that
    exists and cannot take a status refuses the re-arm; an unreachable one must not,
    because the flip's failure says nothing about what the re-drive will read — the path
    is worktree-relative, the worktree may already be gone, and the re-drive mounts a
    fresh one and reads the COMMITTED spec either way. Refusing here would turn the two
    records this row exists to report into a wedge.

    Every other refusal in `rearm_escalation` earns that invariant by sequencing: the
    flip's read-back check raises before `strip_auto_run_result` runs, which is the whole
    reason that strip is ordered after it. The baseline re-stamp cannot be sequenced the
    same way — it needs `task.baseline_commit` from an advance that must itself run after
    the spec block, or a just-cleared stories sentinel is captured as phantom untracked
    residue — so by the time it can fail, the status flip and the result strip are both
    behind it and `save_state` is not.

    This spec is the shape that separates the two writes: a plain, perfectly movable
    `status:` beside a `baseline_revision:` block scalar, which
    `frontmatter._edit_frontmatter_block` refuses (no line edit re-parses to the intended
    value, so no candidate verifies). Without the undo the operator was left with the
    worst of both: the run still calling the story ESCALATED, and a spec already flipped
    to `ready-for-dev` and stripped of the `## Auto Run Result` section the next resolve
    session reads as its context — the one edit nothing else records.

    The undo is no longer written into the re-stamp's own `except` arm: the whole window
    from the first spec write to `save_state` is one transaction, and its guard rolls the
    spec back for every fault that escapes — this one included. What the arm still owns is
    the `RearmError` and its remedy.

    not reach here. That arm guards BOTH spec helpers, and `strip_auto_run_result` is the
    later one: ordering the strip after the check protects the CHECK, but a fault raised
    inside the strip itself is raised with the status flip already published and
    `save_state` still ahead. `strip_auto_run_result` documents that it lets a

    not an accident — and its write is the confined atomic writer, which raises on ENOSPC,
    on EIO, and on a parent component swapped for a link under the `O_NOFOLLOW` walk.

    """The out-of-root undo replaces the NAME, so a link planted at it cannot aim the
    captured bytes into whatever it points at — on the shape this row drives, where that
    file's bytes DIFFER from the preimage.

    That scope is the short-circuit's, not a hedge. `_restore_rearmed_spec` answers
    `"unchanged"` and writes NOTHING when `spec_path.read_bytes()` already equals the
    preimage, and that read follows the link — so a link aimed at a byte-equal file is
    never replaced and there is nothing left for `follow_symlinks` to decide. Reaching
    that shape needs a second actor mutating the spec's name mid-window, which this
    story's triage log has repeatedly found unreachable while the run is paused and the
    resolve session that wrote the spec has terminated. It is therefore left ungraded
    rather than pinned by a row built on an actor that does not exist.

    `_restore_rearmed_spec`'s plain arm passes `follow_symlinks=False`, matching the
    three writers it undoes (`frontmatter.set_frontmatter_status` states the rule).
    That argument was the one thing on this path with no caller-level coverage: the
    sibling rows above drive the arm over a plain regular file, where following or not
    following resolves to the same inode, so dropping the argument left them green while
    the undo silently gained the default's `path.resolve()` — and with it a window in
    which the last thing that touches the spec's name decides which file this re-arm's
    preimage lands in.

    The window is the widened transaction's own: the flip and the strip publish to the
    real file, then the guard's whole residue/advance/`save_state` tail runs before the
    undo looks at the name again. This row plants the link at the last moment inside that
    tail — from the injected `save_state`, so the redirection is in place before the
    rollback and after every write it exists to put back.

    The `restored` record is the third claim rather than a redundant one: the undo has to
    read the link (seeing the OTHER file's bytes, which do not match the preimage), take
    its writer, and land — the same three steps a silent write-through also takes, which
    is why the byte assertions and not the record are what tell the two apart.

    Ablation: drop `follow_symlinks=False` from `_restore_rearmed_spec`'s plain
    `atomic_write_bytes` call and this reddens on the FIRST assertion — the preimage
    lands in the unrelated file — with `not spec.is_symlink()` reddening behind it. The
    final byte comparison stays green through that ablation (it reads THROUGH the link),
    so it cannot carry this row on its own.

    Setup is a `worktree` -> `none` flip: the task still carries the escalated

    `task_spec_path` anchors the re-arm's status flip inside that mount — while
    `_run_story` will re-run the story in the main checkout, which never reads it. The

    So the remedy inverts. Under isolation the correction must be COMMITTED, because
    the replacement worktree is cut from git and reads no working tree. Here the
    re-drive reads the main checkout's WORKING tree, so the correction has to be
    re-applied there and a commit is beside the point — and naming `target_branch`
    would send the operator to the one place this re-drive does not look. Both fields

    `rearm_event_notice` renders out of process from the journal line alone, so it

    checks out TRACKED files only. Gating the abort on `spec_path.is_file()` alone
    refused the re-arm over exactly that copy, and the refusal's remedy — "add a
    top-level `status:` to the spec" — named a file deleted before anything opens it. An

    about how the re-drive routes.

      `rearm-spec-write-unreachable`'s ("commit the corrected spec"), which fires from

    "nothing was persisted", "still escalated" and the spec path, and every one of those
    is true of the `failed` message too — so replacing the discriminator with `if False:`
    was SILENT across the whole suite while an operator holding a part-written spec was
    told it had been "left exactly as the re-arm found it". A row that reads the table
    directly is the only place the three can be compared.

    The unrecognized-value leg is the load-bearing one. `unknown` is a real producer
    answer (the sentinel-clear leg, and a spec the undo could not read), an absent field
    is what a record from an older or future producer looks like, and neither may inherit
    the reassuring branch by falling through to it. So the default is the branch that
    claims nothing, and the assertions below say that in the strongest available form:
    the "left exactly as the re-arm found it" sentence appears on `restored`/`unchanged`
    and NOWHERE else.

    it is the half that costs an operator time — and for one this kind adds: the TUI
