    """`branch_incoming_paths` names both sides of a tracked file/directory
    transition (`a` deleted, `a/b` added), and capturing `a/b` while `a` is
    still a file `lstat`s through a file: `NotADirectoryError`, which the
    capture treated as a fault rather than as absence, so every receipt-backed
    integration of that valid transition paused before the merge and paused
    again on every resume (Codex, #796 review). A leaf beneath a file is
    absent — and the restore, which opens every snapshot's parent as a
    directory before writing (and `mkdir`s it on the checked-path host), must
    leave such an entry alone once `git restore` has put the file back: it is
    absent by topology, nothing to open, nothing to remove. The reverse
    transition (`d/x` deleted, `d` now a file) captures `d` as a tracked
    directory (no snapshot of its own) and `d/x` as the reversible leaf. A
    leaf deeper down (`a/b/c`) records `a/b` as a proved-absent parent, and
    once the file is back that parent is absent by topology too: the
    anchored restore's parent removal opened `a` as a directory and crashed
    on `NotADirectoryError`. A symlink in the file's place (`a -> src.txt`,
    then `a/b`) is captured as `symlink` and put back the same way — and the
    restore's redirection probe, which refuses any symlink on the way to a
    snapshot, must know that this one is the receipt's own restored shape. A
    DANGLING symlink there (`a -> missing`) is a valid tracked entry git
    replaces the same way, yet capturing `a/b` resolved the ancestor
    `strict=True` and refused "unavailable parent" before the merge (Codex,
    #796 review): nothing can be reached through a dangling link, so the leaf
    beneath it is absent by topology and the link's own parent is what
    confines it. A link that RESOLVES to a directory already holding the
    leaf's name (`a -> dir`, `dir/b` tracked, incoming `a/b`) is the same
    transition, yet the capture dereferenced it — `a/b` read as the existing
    `dir/b` — and the snapshot stream refused `a` as a redirected parent
    (Codex, #796 review): git tracks no path through a symlink, so a leaf
    beneath a link the incoming set replaces is absent by topology wherever
    the link points, and stays absent by topology once the link is back —
    the completeness reading must not reach through it either. Wherever it
    points includes outside the repository: the confinement reading used to
    follow a resolving link and refuse the leaf as "escaped the repository",
    yet nothing is read or written through the link — it is captured and
    put back as bytes under its own path — so the link's own parent is what
    confines the leaf beneath it.

    Ablation: catch `FileNotFoundError` alone in the capture and the
    `file-to-directory` row reds on the raise; drop the topology skip from
    the restore and it reds on the restore's parent opening; skip the
    topology test in the absent-parents removal and the anchored deep row
    reds on `NotADirectoryError`; ignore `captured_links` in
    `_absent_beneath_a_file` and the symlink rows red on "redirected"."""

    written into the working tree BEFORE `zzz.dat` reaches the filter and kills
    the merge. Rename either side of that boundary and git dies before writing
    anything, which is a genuine pre-flight refusal and not this shape at all.

    ``tracked`` decides which residue axis the failure leaves behind: False adds
    `aaa.txt` on the branch only (it lands untracked, and nothing restores it),
    True commits it on main first so the branch REWRITES it (` M aaa.txt`, which
    `reset --hard HEAD` undoes).

    `.gitattributes` is committed BEFORE the branch is cut, so both sides carry it
    and it is in force in the TARGET at merge time; the filter config is armed
    AFTER the branch is built, so the branch's own `git add` never runs it. Both
    config writes are repo-LOCAL, so nothing outside this sandbox filters anything.

    """The FOURTH #619 shape, and the one no index- or HEAD-based probe can see.

    git can die in the middle of writing the incoming files out. When it does it
    rolls the INDEX back and stops, leaving the files it already wrote in the
    working tree as UNTRACKED — so `ls-files -u` is empty, `MERGE_HEAD` is absent,
    and `git diff --quiet HEAD --` exits 0 because an untracked file is in neither
    HEAD nor the index. Every probe the classifier had said "refused before
    starting", and `merge_local` then told the operator their checkout was
    unchanged while the residue sat there.

    The residue is the harm, not the wording: it is exactly the shape git refuses
    the NEXT merge over (`untracked working tree files would be overwritten`), so
    the run fails identically on every resume, over paths no message had named.
    Neither restore reaches it — `git reset --hard` and `git merge --abort` both
    leave untracked files alone (measured) — which is why this is classified and
    reported rather than cleaned.

    Both strategies, because both legs check out and both were affected; both
    topologies, because the refusal renders differently when the merge would have
    been a fast-forward.

    The `not isinstance` assertion carries the row: `GitError` alone passes for all
    four states and `MergePreflightError` is a subclass of neither. The `paths`
    assertion is the second half — a correct class carrying nothing to act on
    leaves the operator exactly as stuck.

    Ablation (predicate axis): drop the `materialized` arm from `merge_branch`'s
    discriminator and exactly six rows fail — these four, the `ff` sibling below,
    and the names-only row, whose expected class collapses with the arm — every

    An incoming path the target does not already track lands as an untracked add.
    An incoming path it DOES track is rewritten in place, so `ls-files --others`
    never mentions it and the delta is empty — while the checkout now holds
    incoming content on a tracked path. That is the same harm in a different
    shape: git refuses the next merge over it ("Your local changes to the
    following files would be overwritten by merge"), so a run told its checkout
    was unchanged fails on every resume.

    Unlike the untracked axis, this one IS restorable, and a path-scoped
    `git checkout HEAD --` over exactly the attributed paths is what restores it
    — never a repo-wide reset, whose blast radius is the seventh shape's rows
    below. So the row asserts both halves: the classification is
    `MergeHalfAppliedError` (the CAUSE is a stopped checkout, not a target-state
    clash, and the remedies differ), and the tree is genuinely put back.

    All three strategies, because all three check out. `ff` is the row that
    matters most: its leg carried an explicit "--ff-only never starts a merge"
    premise and did no residue detection at all, so a fast-forward killed
    mid-checkout left the target rewritten with nothing to restore it.

    Ablation (repair): sever the `_restore_rewritten_paths` call from all three

    index-probe squash row. That last pair is worth keeping in the record:
    `rewritten` is the same attributed value that gates #619's pre-existing
