    git can die in the middle of writing the incoming files out. When it does it
    rolls the INDEX back and stops, leaving the files it already wrote in the
    working tree as UNTRACKED — so `ls-files -u` is empty, `MERGE_HEAD` is absent,
    and `git diff --quiet HEAD --` exits 0 because an untracked file is in neither
    HEAD nor the index. Every probe the classifier had said "refused before
    starting", and `merge_local` then told the operator their checkout was
    unchanged while the residue sat there.

    The residue is the harm, not the wording: it is exactly the shape git refuses
    the NEXT merge over (`untracked working tree files would be overwritten`), so
    the run fails identically on every resume, over paths no message had named.
    Neither restore reaches it — `git reset --hard` and `git merge --abort` both

    Both strategies, because both legs check out and both were affected; both

    four states and `MergePreflightError` is a subclass of neither. The `paths`

    leaves the operator exactly as stuck.

    incoming content on a tracked path. That is the same harm in a different
    shape: git refuses the next merge over it ("Your local changes to the
    following files would be overwritten by merge"), so a run told its checkout
    was unchanged fails on every resume.

    Unlike the untracked axis, this one IS restorable, and a path-scoped
    `git checkout HEAD --` over exactly the attributed paths is what restores it
    — never a repo-wide reset, whose blast radius is the seventh shape's rows
    below. So the row asserts both halves: the classification is

    clash, and the remedies differ), and the tree is genuinely put back.

    All three strategies, because all three check out. `ff` is the row that
    matters most: its leg carried an explicit "--ff-only never starts a merge"
    premise and did no residue detection at all, so a fast-forward killed
