"""Phase 4: plugin-provided workflows + the worked-example plugin.

Three layers, mirroring the hook-bus test split:

  * **registry** — ``workflows_for`` / ``workflow_stages`` and the active-plugin
    gate (a workflow from an un-enabled ``[python]`` plugin must not fire any more
    than its module runs);
  * **engine integration** — a provided workflow injects an extra agent session at
    post_dev_phase through the generic ``_run_session`` path; the prompt
    substitutes; a *blocking* workflow whose session fails defers the unit; a
    non-blocking one is advisory; a workflow-free run is byte-identical; the
    board-ownership prohibition rides every injected prompt post-gate (#437);
  * **the example plugin** — ``examples/plugins/guardrails`` loads, enables, and
    exercises its setting, observe hook, veto gate, commit mutation, and provided
    workflow end-to-end.
